>I joke sometimes that using AI, and especially using coding agents, is a bit like playing the piano. The piano is the easiest instrument to begin playing (anyone can produce a satisfying tone with no training or skill on a piano, which is not true of, say, a flute or a violin), yet the hardest to master in the long run. AI presents the greatest opportunity and the greatest challenge computers can muster: a white sheet of paper, a blinking cursor in an empty text input box. You can type anything you like, but figuring out what to type, is, indeed, the hard part.

In a parallel observation, the other day a coworker of mine confided that he often describes ChatGPT as hard to use as Photoshop. On the surface, this sounds absurd, especially coming from a professional designer. ChatGPT is deceptively simple, and Photoshop is anything but. Yet all of these tools—nay, instruments!—greet you with a yawning empty state: a blank canvas, an empty text box, the imposing row of glossy black and white keys. To do *something* with any of them is not particularly hard—the difficulty is in knowing what you want from them in the first place. All afford incredible power and expressive fidelity, a nearly unlimited number of possible directions in which to proceed, none of which is immediately obvious. The space of possibility overwhelms to the point of paralysis; the incline on the upward slope to mastery is incredibly steep.
