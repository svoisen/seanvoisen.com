Lately, I've been thinking about the many metaphors we use as shorthand for describing and understanding large language models (LLMs). Has any technology in the history of humankind amassed such a rich and diverse collection in such a short amount of time? 

Let's quickly go through the list:

First, the Silicon Valley hype machine often describes LLMs in the rosiest of hues, calling them "intelligent agents," capable of accomplishing any number of tasks with ease and little supervision. 

Others, often engineers who work for those same people turning the crank on the hype machine, tend to be a bit more reserved in their enthusiasm. In those circles we might hear LLMs likened to "overzealous interns," less-than-adept helpers that often require significant oversight and limited trust. 

If we move further along the spectrum from optimistic to critical, we find academics, such as Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru, calling LLMs "[stochastic parrots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot)," evoking imagery of the machine’s bird-brain-like inability to understand the meaning of the words it mindlessly strings together. 

Similarly critical, the science fiction writer Ted Chiang coined the phrase "[a blurry JPEG of the web](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web)," which, in likening LLMs to a lossy compression algorithm, highlights the inevitably never-quite-accurate and derivative nature of a model’s output.

The list of metaphors extends well beyond these few examples, of course, including:

- Autocomplete on steroids
- Computerized [wisdom of the crowd](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19379)
- Alien intelligence
- Mirrors of humanity
- Intelligence forklifts
- [Fauxtomation](https://sketchplanations.com/fauxtomation)

Each of these metaphors tells a story, about the opinions and motivations of its progenitor, about the particular ways in which the technology may (or may not) function, about the ways the technology hinders or helps its users, solves problems or creates new ones, appears to us, exploits or benefits, changes what it means to be human.

In [Metaphors We Live By](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780226468013), George Lakoff argues that metaphors are not linguistic decor, not mere filigree for poetic embellishment. Rather, they serve a critical cognitive function:

>Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature ... Because we reason in terms of metaphor, the metaphors we use determine a great deal about how we live our lives.

Metaphors are thus cognitive shorthand, offering specific affordances for reasoning and thinking about the complexity of our world. They both conceal and reveal, and no metaphor can capture the entire picture of any technology, let alone something as complex as a large language model. Instead, we need something more like a "bestiary of metaphors." Amalgamated together, such a collection acts like a multidimensional Necker Cube, allowing for multiple perspectives on the same thing, but never quite allowing all of those perspectives to be seen simultaneously.

Recently, I've been re-reading Borges. It has reminded me that some of our best metaphors for technology come from fiction. Borges' [Garden of Forking Paths](https://live-cdn-www.nypl.org/s3fs-public/jorge_luis_borges_the_garden_of_forking_paths.pdf), for instance, has long served as a muse for media scholars and technologists, in many ways anticipating the invention of hypertext long before it was invented.

If you're unfamiliar with the story, here's a quick synopsis: Yu Tsun, a Chinese spy working for German forces during World War I, discovers that British intelligence has discovered his whereabouts. Fleeing for his life, Tsun seeks safety with a man named Stephen Albert, a sinologist who, as it happens, is studying the work of Tsun's ancestor, a provincial Chinese governor named Ts'ui Pên. As the narrative unfolds, we learn that, towards the end of his life, Pên retired from his work in government to undertake a rather enigmatic quest: to write "a novel that would be even more populous than the _[Hung Lu Meng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber "Dream of the Red Chamber")_", and construct "a labyrinth in which all men would become lost."

Tsun soon arrives at the home of Albert, and in conversation, Albert reveals that he believes the novel and labyrinth to not be two distinct projects, but rather to be one and the same: a literary "garden of forking paths," a book with not one storyline, but multiple simultaneous, parallel timelines, forking indefinitely into the future. Pên's novel is thus not a novel at all, but a literary "labyrinth" with a single starting point that branches into infinite possible fictional worlds.

This garden of forking paths is an apt metaphor for the LLM, which is, at its heart, a fiction machine. All possible fictions exist, simultaneously, in superposition within the weights of the model, awaiting a single "seed"—the user's prompt—which sets the machine into action, navigating its labyrinth, emitting new fictions, token by token.

Some of these fictions prove genuinely useful, others benign, and still others malignant. But they are all, in the end, fictions.

In their essay [Borges and AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01425), Léon Bottou and Bernhard Schölkopf reach a similar conclusion, noting that, there are many uses for a fiction machine: "... their stories can enrich our lives, help us revisit the past, understand the present, or even catch a glimpse of the future."

But in trying to transform a fiction machine into something other than what it is, we run into difficulties. We must remember that there are invisible forces are at work, reshaping the garden of forking paths against its nature: severing branches, pruning storylines, trying to transmute fiction into fact.

The garden of forking paths is not a perfect map of the world; it is a labyrinth of stories we do not even control. The burden of making sense of the stories we encounter as we wind our way through the maze remains uniquely our own.
