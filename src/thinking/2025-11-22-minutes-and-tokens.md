In [Technology and the Lifeworld](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780253205605), philosopher of technology Don Ihde discusses how the invention of the clock radically shifted both humankind’s *perception* of time, as well as what we determine to be most salient in the *measurement* of time. With clocks, rather than “read the heavens” we now read a machine. The invention of the clock redirected our collective focus from the slower, subtly shifting rhythms of nature to the rigid regularity of a mechanical device.

Clocks are so ubiquitous in modern life that it’s easy to forget—like any technology—that they have evolved and changed since their original inception. One thing I had never considered before reading Ihde was that the earliest mechanical clocks were one-handed. While dividing the day into twenty-four intervals radically changed things for humanity compared to pre-clock cultures, the introduction of the minute hand further accelerated our collective focus on the now, propelling us closer to what philosopher Byung-Chul Han calls our “temporal crisis.” Ihde writes:

> One-handed clocks, which discriminated between hours, were superseded quite early by two-handed clocks, which further divided or quantified time into minutes. Two things occur in this refinement of measurement: First, not only is time more finely quantified into smaller units, but in a very subtle sense, one can say that minutes gradually become more "important" than the larger hour unit. The trajectory is towards the instant, making it more focal and consequently placing the duration of time more in the background.

As Ihde argues, the greater importance on temporal granularity—what he calls the “primacy of the instant”—radically shifts even our social norms. A pre-clock culture, for instance, has no idea of what it means to be 15 minutes late to anything. You couldn’t “waste” 15 minutes in pre-clock cultures. But a post-clock culture obsesses over even this tiny degree of tardiness.

We forget that clocks are what make minutes (and seconds and hours) possible and perceptible in the first place. These tiny granular units that we now perceive as most “important” emerged from a mechanism of our own invention, and later spread around the world through Western technological imperialism.

In thinking about other ways in which modern technologies shift what we perceive to be salient through measurement and atomization, I realized there’s a parallel here in the world of AI: the humble token. 

Just as the minute emerged from the capabilities of mechanical clockwork, the token has emerged from the computational requirements of language models. Just as the minute creates new granularities of scarcity and measurement of time, the token has created awareness around the scarcity of computation. Just as the minute hand calls our attention to wasted time, so the token makes us aware of wasted inference.

But, there’s a critical difference between the minute and the token: Our technologies of timekeeping make minutes perennially conspicuous. Systems of generative AI, however, often intentionally obfuscate token use. While “time is money” is largely metaphorical, “tokens are money” hits much closer to the truth. The token makes visible the cost of AI, yet demands to be hidden lest that cost become too apparent. It is thus both salient and obscure—a unit of measurement designed to remain hidden, even as it governs what we can and cannot afford to ask of our most modern of machines.
