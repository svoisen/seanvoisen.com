## Design

I like fast web pages, and I've intentionally designed this site with a minimalist aesthetic aimed at small payloads and fast load times, even on low-power devices or devices with limited bandwidth.

The current design is a blend of ideas from older versions of my blog, as well as inspiration taken from [Matt Widmann's personal site](https://mattwidmann.net/).

## Coding and production

This site is built using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and served using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I typically compose content using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) before copying it into [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for final publication. If you're curious, the source code for this site is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/svoisen/seanvoisen.com).

## AI Usage

I believe personal websites are about the fostering of human relationships. As such, I do not use AI to generate any content on this site, and never will.

## Privacy and analytics

- This site does not use any third party tracking scripts. 
- This site does not collect any data. 
- This site does not use any JavaScript at all except for the sole purpose of obfuscating my email address from bots and harvesters.
- I am a [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org) affiliate. Links to books on this site typically use my affiliate link, which means I may receive a small commission on any purchases made through the link.
