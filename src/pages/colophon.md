## Programming and production

This site is built using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and served using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The source code for this site is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/svoisen/seanvoisen.com). I typically compose content using either [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) or [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) before any final production or editing workflows in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). 

## Design

I like fast web pages, and I've intentionally designed this site with a minimalist aesthetic aimed at small payloads and fast load times so that it performs well even on low-power devices and devices with limited bandwidth.

The current design is a blend of ideas from older versions of my blog, as well as inspiration taken from [Matt Widmann's personal site](https://mattwidmann.net/).
