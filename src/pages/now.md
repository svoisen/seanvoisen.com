This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), a brief summary of what I'm
currently focused on.

## Updated on February 21, 2025

A very wet and cold winter seems to be slowly giving way to spring, and it's warming up here in
Northern California. The cherry plum tree in my backyard has started to bloom,
and my kids and I just returned from a neighborhood bike ride and trip to the
local gelato shop.

## Leading "design engineers" (or whatever you'd like to call them)

As "Director of Design Engineering" at Adobe, I'm immensely fortunate to be
leading a 40+ person organization of hybrid designer-developers who do
everything from build our design system to partner with product teams on
high-fidelity prototyping of new products and features.

Beyond growing the team, I'm currently focused on exploring the future of UX
engineering in a world where AI-based tools are empowering designer-developer
generalists like those on my team to do more.

## Working on this site

A major recent focus of any spare time for side projects has been getting a new
version of my personal site/blog/digital garden both redesigned and migrated
from Jekyll to Eleventy. If you're reading this, it means I finally got it to
the point where I'm comfortable sharing it publicly.

## Learning Julia

One of my goals this year has been to get back into creative coding for pen
plotter artwork using a new programming language. Historically, I always used Python. After a lot of evaluation of various Lisp flavors,
I landed on [Julia](https://julialang.org/) for future projects. It's still early days, but I'm having
a lot of fun learning.

## Baking

I'm still baking sourdough bread and bagels. I recently acquired a [Challenger
Bread Pan](https://challengerbreadware.com/product/the-challenger-bread-pan/)
and it has been a game-changer, especially for batard-shaped loaves.
