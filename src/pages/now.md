This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), a brief summary of what I'm
currently focused on.

## Updated on February 21, 2025

A very wet and cold winter seems to be slowly giving way to spring, and it's warming up here in
Northern California. The cherry plum tree in my backyard has started to bloom,
and my kids and I just returned from a neighborhood bike ride and trip to the
local gelato shop.

## Leading "design engineers" ...

... or whatever you'd like to call them. I'm currently 
leading a 40+ person organization of hybrid designer-developers at
[Adobe](https://adobe.design) who do
everything from build [our design system](https://spectrum.adobe.com) to partner with product teams on
high-fidelity prototyping of new products and features.

Beyond growing the team (I'm fortunate to be hiring!) I'm currently focused on exploring the future of UX
engineering and prototyping in a world where AI-based tools are empowering designer-developer
generalists like those on my team to do even more.

## Working on this site

A major recent focus of any spare time for side projects has been getting a new
version of my personal site/blog/digital garden both redesigned and migrated
from Jekyll to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). If you're reading this, it means I finally got it to
the point where I'm comfortable sharing it publicly.

## Parenting and travel

My kids are now 6 and almost 8, which has made travel and family outings *much*
easier than ever before. We just returned from a short, local trip to Monterey and
Carmel to explore the tide pools and California coast. And we have a few camping
trips planned for later in the spring and early summer that I'm very much
looking forward to.

## Learning Julia

One of my goals this year is to get back into creative coding pen
plotter artwork using a new programming language. Historically, I have always used Python in the [Vsketch](https://vsketch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) environment. However, I was always frustrated by Python's performance, and really wanted a language with a better REPL experience for rapid experimentation. After a lot of evaluation of various Lisp flavors,
I've landed on [Julia](https://julialang.org/) instead for future projects. It's still early days, but I'm having
a lot of fun learning.

## Baking

On weekends I'm still baking sourdough bread and bagels. I recently acquired a [Challenger
Bread Pan](https://challengerbreadware.com/product/the-challenger-bread-pan/)
and it has been a game-changer, especially for batard-shaped loaves.
