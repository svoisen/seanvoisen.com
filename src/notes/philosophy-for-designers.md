title: "Philosophy for Designers: Ethics, Experience and Cognition"
description: A self-study journey for thoughtful designers and technologists.
status: Work in progress.
---

This is a reading list and self-study journey in philosophy, design and cognitive science that I put together for myself. I'm sharing it here partly because it helps me commit to actually doing it, and partly because I suspect others might find it useful (or might want to read along).

I've organized this journey into a series of "quests," each building on the last. The overarching goal: To explore theoretical foundations for designing digital technologies that honor both human experience and human values. The readings draw from two philosophical traditions that often stay in separate corners: phenomenology (the philosophy of lived experience) and ethics (the study of right action). I've also mixed in some works from design theory, technology criticism, and the group of theories in cognitive science known as [4E cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4E_cognition). Through all this, I'm aiming to build a theoretical toolkit for the design of technology that's both deeply human and genuinely humane.

⚠️ Fair warning: this is a living document. As I work through these readings, I'll likely discover gaps I need to fill or rabbit holes I need to explore. The path might change as I walk it.

## Quest №1: Foundations of Phenomenology and Technology
*Laying the philosophical groundwork for understanding how technology shapes human experience*

Before we can design better tools, we need to understand how humans actually experience technology in the first place. The branch of philosophy known as phenomenology offers us something crucial here: it shows us that technology is never neutral. Instead, our tools fundamentally alter how we perceive, act in, and make sense of our world.

The readings in this quest explore different modes of human-technology relations: how tools become extensions of our bodies (embodiment), how we read the world through technology (hermeneutic), how we relate to technology as quasi-other (alterity), and how technology forms the invisible context of our lives (background).

The ultimate goal of this quest is to build a solid understanding of phenomenology that we can use and draw from in subsequent quests.

## Quest №2: Foundations of Ethics and Technology
*Developing frameworks for ethical evaluation in technological contexts*

After grappling with how we experience technology, I want to turn to the normative questions: How should we design technology? What values should guide us? This quest surveys different ethical traditions—consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics, and care ethics—exploring distinct lenses for understanding technology's moral dimensions.

The readings in this quest remind us that technology is not morally neutral. Every technical choice embeds ethical decisions: who gets included or excluded, what behaviors are encouraged or discouraged, which values are prioritized or marginalized.
