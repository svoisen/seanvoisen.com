A collection of resources that I often share with new and experienced engineering managers.

## For first-timers or those considering management
- [The Engineer/Manager Pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) is one of the very first articles I always recommend to anyone who tells me they are considering management, but is still on the fence about making the switch. It’s a quick read that essentially says: You can always try out management for a few years and switch back to being an IC if you find you don’t like it. In fact, in many cases this is a good career move!
