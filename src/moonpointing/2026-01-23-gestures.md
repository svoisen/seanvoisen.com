Welcome to this, my first newsletter of 2026.

In case it isn't immediately obvious: **this newsletter has a new name!** I wanted something that was short, memorable, and a tad quirky. I landed on "Moonpointing," which I'll explain below.

I think of Moonpointing as the "b-side" to my blog—an informal monthly letter where I share life updates, ponderings, books I'm reading, links I find interesting, and all the other stuff that feeds the writing I put on my blog. This newsletter will range widely across topics in philosophy, design, technology, literature and other things. I hope that's what you signed up for!

Before we get into it, here's table of contents in case you want to jump around:

- [Moonpointing](#moonpointing): On the origins of the name
- [Recent essays](#recent-essays): Highlighting a few things I've published recently
- [Quests (and other ways of reading)](#quests)
- [Books I read in January](#books)
- [My DIY e-ink typewriter](#typewriter)

## Moonpointing

In late summer of last year, we adopted a puppy. His name is Clover, a moniker with which he came pre-endowed. Along with it being somewhat unique and well-suited to his personality, we thought it best to avoid confusing the little guy by trying to change it, so Clover it is!

Anyway ... it quickly became my job to take Clover on early morning walks—you know, to avoid any "accidents" in the house. Now that we are in the thick of our Northern California winter, this means bundling up, grabbing a headlamp, and venturing out into the pre-dawn black of our suburban street. Our house sits on the edge of a large expanse of oak forest that rises up a steep hill, criss-crossed in winter by bubbling streams, and year-round by a series of county-maintained trails. 

Most mornings around here are still and quiet. But the frigid morning air carries distant sounds surprisingly far, and it's not too uncommon to hear the howls of coyotes, the hooting of an owl, the gobble of a well-hidden turkey, or—on Wednesdays—the crash and clang of a garbage truck on a neighboring street.

Each morning, leash in hand, still blurry-eyed from sleep, I look up into the dark expanse of sky to stare at the moon, which lately I have found lounging over the dark shadow of the southern hills. I do this so often that I've started to become intimately familiar with the moon's current phase. This is, I suppose, not so common for a suburban-dwelling human living with modern technology. Who pays close attention to the moon these days?

But at a time when *everything* in the world feels particularly unstable, I've come to take comfort in my early morning moon spotting reveries. The moon has long-served humanity as a friendly celestial constant, dependably waxing and waning in its unfailing 29½ day rhythm, an anchor for mooring our minds against tumultuous seas of change and upheaval. Even a few minutes spent looking up at the moon, staring into the expanse of the night sky, helps put everything back into proper perspective.

In Buddhist mythology the moon represents the underlying, but elusive truth of reality. As it is told in Buddhist lore, centuries ago Siddhartha Gautama reminded his disciples not to confuse his words with truth. He did this through the analogy of a finger pointing at the moon. 

Here it is, from Thich Nhat Han's [Old Path White Clouds](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780938077268):

>... the teaching is merely a vehicle to describe the truth. Don’t mistake it for the truth itself. A finger pointing at the moon is not the moon. The finger is needed to know where to look for the moon, but if you mistake the finger for the moon itself, you will never know the real moon.

The driving force behind all my writing, research, reading and making is my own insatiable curiosity about the reciprocal dance between humanity and technology; the question of how we shape our tools and how our tools—in turn—shape us.

For me this is a perennial question, a "moon" forever out of my reach. And so all I can do is gesture towards that moon with tools, words, stories, links, wild flailing, and—occasionally, hopefully—a well-put newsletter.

## Recent essays

It's been a few months since I last wrote (well I renamed this newsletter), so I should probably highlight a few essays I've my blog since then. This isn't an exhaustive list, but these are two essays I feel most worth highlighting:

- [Cosmotechnics and AI: Reading Hamid Ismailov's We Computers](/writing/cosmotechnics-and-ai/): This was an extraordinarily fun and challenging essay to write—a weird and wild traipsing between ideas from literary theory to Islamic philosophy to cosmotechnics, all inspired by one of the most interesting novels I've read in the past few years.
- [Not a hobby](/writing/not-a-hobby/): Reflections on [my second life habit experiment](/writing/habit-experiment-2-self-directed-study/), in which I learned last year—through my autodidactice adventures in philosophy of technology—that you can, indeed, just do "research as leisure."

<a name="quests"></a>

## Quests (and other ways of reading)

I've long-followed [Alan Jacobs' advice that you should read at Whim](/writing/read-at-whim/) (with the capital "W", mid you). Follow your gut and avoid plodding through deliberate reading lists. But last year as part of my second life habit experiment, I intentionally spurned this idea for a while. Instead, I cobbled together some topically-focused reading "quests", and stuck to them.

Reading by Whim is joyful, and sometimes just what you need in certain times of life. But often when I follow this advice, I also find myself buffeted by the winds of my own wild curiosity. I bounce from book to book, idea to idea, and none of it hangs together in any coherent way. My reading feels unmoored, and I tend to forget much of it, even if I'm diligent in my note-taking marginalia. Not so good if you're actually trying to learn something.

Quest-based reading changed all of that.

The idea of a "quest" is to identify one question or one topic of curiosity, and dig into it with a small collection of books (maybe 5 to 7 or so). Quest-based reading aligns with what Robin Hanson calls [the chasing mode of reading](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/chase-your-readinghtml), where you're focused, asking questions, deeply engaged with the material, and often abandoning things that don't suit your quest.

I keep [a list of my quests in the notes section on my site](/notes/reading-quests/). Last year, my quests focused on phenomenology and technology ethics. This year I'm remaining philosophically-focused, but I'm trying to avoid plowing only through works of non-fiction, instead complementing everything with thematically relevant fiction as well.

---

Of course, quests and Whim aren't the only way to go. There are as many ways to read as there are people in the world.

I really like [Petya Grady's reading projects](https://petya.substack.com/p/what-to-do-about-reading-goals) which feel similar to my quests, but focus specifically on themes in fiction.

Popular essayist Henrik Karlsson also has [a fine collection of notes](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/how-i-read) on how he chooses to read, which is also about chasing:

>Chasing makes you more active and critical of what you read... When you chase, you continually ask yourself whether what you are reading is relevant for your quest, or whether the author actually has anything new or interesting to say.

And, I've always loved L.M. Sacasas' [reading as counter-practice](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/reading-as-counter-practice)—the "deliberately chosen discipline that can form us in ways that run counter to the default settings of our techno-social milieu." Another way to say it: reading is punk!

## Books I read in January

No full-length reviews here, just a few quick thoughts on some books I finished this month.

### [Klara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780593311295)

A beautiful and poignant phenomenology of AI, set in a dystopian future where parents can elect to genetically-enhance their children, but at the risk that it may cost the child their life. I loved it more than Ishiguro's more popular *Remains of the Day* to be honest. 

Also, somehow this is the third novel I've read in recent months narrated by AI; the other two were Hamid Ismailov's [We Computers](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780300272741) and Ann Leckie's [Ancillary Justice](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780316565172). I think I need to start a list!

Yellow text at the top indicates it's a #1 Sunday Times bestseller, and orange text at the bottom notes that Ishiguro is a Nobel Prize in Literature winner." /></a>

### [The Complete Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780544577879)

Such a clever little collection of short stories that explore scientific phenomena through the eyes of an always-extant being with the unpronounceable name of "Qfwfq"; I can't recommend it enough. 

Merve Emre, in [an article for The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-worlds-of-italo-calvino), called Calvino “word for word, the most charming writer to put pen to paper in the twentieth century,” and I think she might be right. I might have moons on the brain, but his story, "The Distance of the Moon," about a time when the moon was so close to earth you can climb up to it on a ladder, is just so brilliant and beautiful. [Radiolab aired a reading of it back in 2013](https://radiolab.org/podcast/282571-distance-of-moon).

The book title 'The Complete Cosmicomics' appears in handwritten script at the bottom of the cover." /></a>

### [Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780156453806)

Cosmicomics put my on a Calvino kick. I immediately picked up Calvino's [Invisible Cities](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780156453806) afterwards. This book reads like a dream—beautiful and strange, like looking at an N-dimensional polyhedron through prose. 

Each chapter is like a tiny poetic glimpse into a strange new world ... or is it? (I won't say more than that for fear of giving too much away.) I'm sure I'll be re-reading this one again soon.

## My DIY e-ink typewriter

Late nights spent in front of a glowing screen negatively impact my sleep quality in noticeable ways. This wasn't always the case; it's one of the "perks" of aging.

But, as a parent of young children, night is often when I have the most available free time for writing (and other side projects). This has put me in a conundrum: How do I set myself up for writing at night?

Of course, the most cost-effective solution is the oldest: just use a paper and pen. As [I've shared before](/writing/wendell-berry-writing-without-a-computer/), writers from Wendell Berry to Neil Gaiman to Mary Oliver have all shunned modern technology in favor of writing by hand. But ... I just can't do it. Maybe it's the decades of my life spent writing code, but I find trying to write first drafts longhand to be painfully slow and frustrating. I need a keyboard.

So, what to do? Fortunately, there is one display technology that does not emit blue light: e-ink.

I absolutely love e-ink displays. The technology has improved immensely over the years, both in resolution and responsiveness, and many modern e-ink devices are a joy to use, both for reading and writing. In addition to readers and tablets, there are now also plenty of e-ink "typewriter" solutions on the market. [Freewrite](https://getfreewrite.com) makes some very nice looking ones (their [Hemingwrite](https://getfreewrite.com/products/hemingwrite) in particular looks absolutely beautiful). But I don't understand shelling out so much money what amounts to a tiny e-ink display attached to a keyboard. Especially for something I'm unsure I will even use. So I cobbled together my own.

!["A cream-colored mechanical keyboard with white circular keys displayed next to a Palma 2 e-ink device mounted on a stand. The e-ink screen displays a minimalist line drawing of a hot air balloon with handwritten text beneath it. The keyboard features a vintage typewriter aesthetic with clearly labeled keys including function keys (Ctrl, Option, Win, Command), letter keys, and a spacebar. Both devices are positioned against a white textured wall with dark trim, creating a minimalist writing setup that bridges digital and physical writing tools."](/assets/images/eink_typewriter.jpg "My DIY e-ink typewriter.")

This is my DIY e-ink typewriter, an Onyx Boox Palma 2 paired with a cheap bluetooth keyboard designed for holding tablets. The small screen on the Palma keeps me focused, and since it runs Android, I can type directly into my notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (which automatically syncs with all my other devices). I'm still getting used to it (the keyboard is just *fine*), but so far so good.
