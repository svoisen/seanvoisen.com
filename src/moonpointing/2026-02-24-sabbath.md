>He who wants to enter the holiness of the day must first lay down the profanity of clattering commerce, of being yoked to toil. He must go away from the screech of dissonant days, from the nervousness and fury of acquisitiveness and the betrayal in embezzling his own life. He must say farewell to manual work and learn to understand that the world has already been created and will survive without the help of man. Six days a week we wrestle with the world, wringing profit from the earth; on the Sabbath we especially care for the seed of eternity planted in the soul. 
>
>— Abraham Heschel

I was reminded of this quote by theologian and philosopher Abraham Heschel last week, holed up—as I was—in a small cabin, while a much-needed late winter storm blanketed California's Sierra Nevada mountains with three feet of glorious, powdery snow. With the roads closed, devices left at home, and the conditions unfit for anything save regular shoveling, the urgency that ordinarily propels the day had nowhere to go. What was there to do but live and rest? For a few short days, the world contracted to the window, the cup of coffee, the book in hand, the games played with kids. Outside a hush fell over the surrounding woods, everything softened, muffled, still, reverent.

Winter is the season when our circadian rhythms ask us to slow down, to lie a little fallow, to let our minds rest in a way that might feel unproductive, but is actually just necessary mental composting: a kind of turning things over in the dark without the pressure to produce. Without such composting, how else will the "seed of eternity" ever sprout?

![Monet's largest winter painting — a snow-covered Norman countryside, no human figures, just a solitary magpie on a gate, blue shadows falling across fresh white snow.](/assets/images/the_magpie@1600.webp "The Magpie by Claude Monet (1868-69).")

Writing these words after a week of "unyoking" myself in the middle of February, and noting that winter (at least here in the Northern Hemisphere) is rapidly coming to a close, I can't help but think about the irony in how we typically schedule vacations. Summer, when most of us take holidays, offers long days and warm weather, but it is also—energetically speaking—the season of output, of expansion, of doing. It is not the season of rest, but of productivity and adventure. No, if any season demands the laying down of the "profanity of clattering commerce" it's winter. Winter is—if you'll indulge me—a season of Sabbath.

It feels strange to be engaging in and encouraging rest at a time when the message of the entire world (or at least the tiny slice of the world that pays way too much attention to technology) is telling us we are stuck on the Red Queen's accelerating treadmill, having to run ever faster just to stay in the same place. If you work in tech (and perhaps even if you don't) you don't have to listen too intently to hear the voices shouting: *Something big is happening!* *If you don't learn how to use AI in the next 18 months you'll be out of a job!* *It's 8pm. Do you know what your agents are doing?* And so forth and so on.

Meanwhile, the people deepest in the weeds are [already writing about "AI fatigue"](https://siddhantkhare.com/writing/ai-fatigue-is-real). We should know now, from the many histories of technological revolutions, that new tools of automation *never* free us from work; they simply invent new forms of (often deskilled) labor and create pressure for ever-higher levels of output. We are, after all, an insatiable species.

This is why I appreciate [the pragmatic wisdom of writers like Oliver Burkeman](https://ckarchive.com/b/k0umh6h5rwz88a6n33wn4aorrer77f8hgxwdn), who reminds us that insecurity is simply part of the human condition: "The reason 'you're not ready for what's coming next' ... is that we're never ready for what's coming next." Just as it's ill-advised to bury one's head in the sand or avoid experimenting with new tools (especially if your employment is increasingly contingent on the use of such tools), it's equally ill-advised to succumb to gut-wrenching anxiety and try to stay on top of every possible new development. Pace yourself—in six months it's all going to be different, again.

So I say: Take a walk. Lay down in the falling snow and make snow angels. Read the books that have nothing to do with your career. Let your mind wander without immediately harvesting whatever it surfaces. The treadmill will always be there when you come back.

## Programming in the swamp

In case you missed it, [my latest essay is out](/writing/programming-in-the-swamp/). Fair warning: this one is aimed squarely at people who either write software for a living, or manage people who do. It's about what agentic AI is doing to the *experience* of programming. This is not your usual productivity discourse—it's about what the work actually *feels* like now.

This one was a pleasure to write, pulling together ideas from biosemiotics, like Jakob von Uexküll's *umwelt*, and exploring whether there is joy to be found in our new world of AI-birthed "ooze."

## Words, words, words

While I promise my newsletter is *not* an AI newsletter, it's a hard topic for me to avoid. As a writer and a reader and a programmer, AI threatens to change so much of what I hold dear, some of it good, and some of it in absolutely terrible ways.

Oh but those two little letters—A and I—belie so much of what it's all about! Not *intelligence*, but *language.* [Over $2.5 trillion spent globally](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2026-1-15-gartner-says-worldwide-ai-spending-will-total-2-point-5-trillion-dollars-in-2026) on infrastructure and energy and labor and GPUs and all the other things just so computers can do one thing really well: conjure up words. It turns out words strung together in syntactically and semantically correct ways—irrespective of whether a sentient being or a mere simulacrum of intelligence did the stringing—can do astonishing things. The world is moved by words.

This month I read Leif Weatherby's [Language Machines](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781517919320), which argues that we don't have adequate theory developed to understand LLMs as machines that generate language, and thus also culture and ideology. Weatherby's primary target is what he calls "remainder humanism": the tendency to draw ever-shrinking lines between human and machine language, arguing that whatever the machine does, the human does it _better_, or more _truly_, or with actual _intent_ behind it. This is a losing game, he says, and it distracts us from more important investigations. If structuralism is correct, and language is a closed system of signs that need not be grounded in the world, that need not have a *mind* behind it, then how do we make sense of LLMs?

The author's name appears at the top, the title 'Language Machines' in large serif type in the center, and the subtitle below. The background shows a partially visible bookshelf with various colorful book spines including blue, orange, and red titles." /></a>

Language Machines proved to be a highly transformative but difficult read. I openly admit I only understood about 40% of the text; and much of that was the bits I already knew—the technical underpinnings, the history of [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), and so on. Without a background in linguistics or semiotics, the other parts were slow going. But that 40% I did understand was enough to shift much of my thinking about the critique of the technology and its place in the world.

But this isn't about that book.

In my last newsletter I shared one of my new reading strategies involves [reading in quests](/writing/habit-experiment-2-self-directed-stud). As a follow-up experiment, this year I've been trying to read complementary works of fiction and non-fiction simultaneously. The idea is simple: fiction and non-fiction circle the same philosophical territory from opposite directions, and maybe something interesting happens in the overlap.

I had only loosely planned [Embassytown](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780345524508) by China Miéville as a companion to *Language Machines.* What I didn't anticipate was how completely Miéville's novel would dramatize Weatherby's central argument. The Ariekei, the alien inhabitants of the novel's titular colony, speak a language that must be simultaneously voiced by two mouths tied to a single mind, and can only refer to things that actually exist. It is, in Weatherby's terms, a fictional representation of perfectly grounded language—anchored in lived experience, unable to float free. When the Ariekei encounter ungrounded language, untethered to a sentient mind, it acts as a kind of drug, literally destroying them through addiction.

Below is a gradient transitioning from grayscale to black, depicting a dense crowd of silhouetted figures, with an illuminated alien cityscape of tall spires glowing in gold at the bottom. The title 'Embassytown' appears in large white letters across the dark section. A quote from Ursula K. Le Guin reading 'A fully achieved work of art' is featured near the bottom." /></a>
</figure>

I won't give away the ending; no spoilers here. But the image of a species undone by its addiction to language without a mind behind it—language that feels meaningful, that _acts_ meaningfully, while referring to nothing and no one—is one I haven't been able to shake. It seems worth asking whether the Ariekei's predicament is quite as alien as Miéville intended.

I feel an essay coming on ...

## Links and things

I've [written about Yuk Hui's concept of cosmotechnics in the past](/writing/cosmotechnics-and-ai/), but [let's talk about mythotechnics!](https://twfi.substack.com/p/mythotechnics-on-the-poetic-infrastructure) Mythotechnics is: "a critical and creative method for working with myth as a structuring grammar of AI cultures." That is: the study of the stories we tell about our own technologies, most especially AI.

I feel this topic needs way more attention than it receives if we are to break away from the unproductive "monomyth" of AI as Frankensteinian threat to human existence and move towards other, more productive, critical and useful mythologies, what the author calls "mythological pluralism."

I enjoyed [this video interview with Richard Sutton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21EYKqUsPfg), inventor of reinforcement learning, on LLMs as a dead end because they lack the capacity for true on-the-job learning. LLMs don't have a goal of learning; they have a goal of mimicry—they aim to simulate intelligence—which is a very different thing!

[Cat turds](https://www.scottsmitelli.com/articles/altoids-by-the-fistful/) is my new favorite term for tedious and unpleasant tasks in software development.

I absolutely loved [this essay on essay writing as an act of personal sovereignty](https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/essay-writing-as-personal-sovereignty):

>Writing freezes your amorphous, gaseous thoughts onto the page; editing is the act of dissolving prose to see and interrogate your ideas. It is a slow, often daunting process, but it is the cost of intellectual sovereignty.⁠⁠

A worthwhile reminder at a time when it's so easy to abdicate yourself of this sovereignty and let the machines do the thinking process for you.
