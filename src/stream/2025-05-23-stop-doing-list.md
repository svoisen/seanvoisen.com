Last month I finished [Subtract](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781250249876), a great, quick read about how *less* is often better in many circumstances, but could probably do a better job following its own advice.

Anyway ... one compelling tip that author Leidy Klotz shares is the idea of a "stop doing list." Many of us (self included) are often guilty of keeping todo lists that seem to grow with each passing day. But few of us create lists of the things we want to *stop* doing or simply say "no" to. So, I created one of my own. Maybe if I publish it, I will hold myself more accountable to stop doing the things I say I'm going to stop doing.

This is my current "stop doing list," a short collection of activities I've found to be wasteful of my time and in which I am making a concerted effort to no longer do:

- Reading social media feeds of any kind. This includes Mastodon and Bluesky. If it's not on RSS I won't see it.
- Reading major news outlets. I listen to NPR in the morning, and I read independent media. If it's being reported by a major news outlet I'm probably going to hear about it anyway.
- Going down research rabbit holes on a whim, especially on my phone. From now on, I will jot down the question and wait at least 24 hours to see if it's still worth looking into. Odds are, it won't be.
- Continuously honing my note taking systems or generally engaging in "productivity theater." I use Obsidian and I use plain paper notebooksâ€”whatever's on hand to capture the passing thought or idea. There is no perfect system and I'd rather focus on producing output than over-organizing input.
- Generally, worrying about anything over which I have absolutely no control. I choose to focus on initiatives and issues over which I can have some actual influence. I can do very little about the activities of the current administration, but I *can* join my local teachers' union on the picket line. I can do very little about being blindsided by an unexpected health crisis, but I can maintain an active and healthy lifestyle.

Will this list grow? Perhaps. But if less truly *is* better, than maybe I should be keeping this list brief too.
