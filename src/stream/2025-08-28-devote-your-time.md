Sometimes you need to allow a field to lie fallow. Sometimes you need a break. Sometimes, if your life feels overwhelming and time is moving by way too fast, what you need is to inject silence and space for lingering to remind yourself what it is to feel human.

Designer Frank Chimero [recently posted on his blog](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2025/time-is-on-my-side/) after what looks like a four year hiatus, reflecting on his recent sabbatical. I hope he keeps it up. This is how he closes it:

>I asked AI what we do with time, and it came back with words that were commercial and violent. We spend time, save time, take time, and make it; manage, track, and save it; we kill time, we pass it, we waste it, borrow, and steal it. We abuse time and it beats us back up, either in retribution or self-defense. It’s a zero-sum perspective of the material of our lives; it makes us prisoners to our own utility.
>
>The AI said nothing about love, loyalty, or enthusiasm. When you wrap those up, it becomes clear that the best thing to do with time is to devote it. That is how you get time on your side. When you are working with time instead of against it, every bit matters, it all counts, even the fallow times, the empty times, the time off the path.⁠

"Devote" is an excellent word choice here. We don't often devote our time to those things that matter most. We *use* our time instead. 

I'm reminded of a book of collected poetry by Mary Oliver entitled, fittingly, [Devotions](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780399563263). This anthology includes her famous poem *The Summer Day*, which also ends in an equally famous call to devotion:

>Tell me, what is it you plan to do
>with your one wild and precious life?

Sometimes the only way to answer such a question is just to make space for it, to—as Chimero points out—take "time off the path."
