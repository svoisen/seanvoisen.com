Most people think of multitasking as a uniquely human capability. In [The Burnout Society](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780804795098) Byung-Chul Han flips this completely on its head, calling the propensity to multitask a "regression" because even animals are capable of multitasking:

> The attitude toward time and environment known as “multitasking” does not represent civilizational progress. Human beings in the late-modern society of work and information are not the only ones capable of multitasking. Rather, such an aptitude amounts to regression. Multitasking is commonplace among wild animals. It is an attentive technique indispensable for survival in the wilderness.
 
In Han's view, what is uniquely human is not multitasking, it's "single tasking." It's the ability to focus on a single thing in deep contemplation—the *vita contemplativa.*
