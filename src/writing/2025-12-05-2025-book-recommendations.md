It is reading season. I know because the nights have grown long, and I just finished hoisting a live tree up a flight of stairs, festooning it with lights, and spending far too much time protecting it from repeated attack by our feline housemates. After all that, and putting the kids to sleep, I just want to hole up with a good book.

Like a squirrel collecting nuts, I collect book recommendations. And to find the best nuts, it sometimes helps to seek out the advice of other squirrels who share your taste. So, one of my annual blogging traditions includes reflecting on my reading for the past year—revisiting [books that I’ve read](/bookshelf), and thinking a bit about those that I enjoyed most or proved most influential. After that, I always try to share a few favorites that I think others may enjoy, just in case there are a few other squirrels like me out there.

If you've been following along, you know that this has been my "year of philosophy." As part of my [second life habit experiment](/writing/habit-experiment-2-self-directed-study/), I spent a good chunk of the latter half of 2025 going deep into philosophical topics somewhere at the intersection of design, technology, phenomenology, and (to a lesser extent), ethics. Many of the ideas I absorbed as part of these autodidactic philosophical (mis)adventures also found their way into much of my writing during the latter half of the year as well. 

In considering a book to recommend to others, I tend to ask myself: Did it stick with me? Do I seem to think about it often? Did it influence my writing or thinking or perspective in some profound way? To answer a resounding “yes” to each of these questions, a book usually has both great ideas *and* good writing. Many of the philosophy books I read this year had plenty of the former, but they were too opaque and academic to satisfy my criteria on the latter. This makes them hard to recommend in a list like this (even if I enjoyed them). So, each of the books listed below center on philosophical issues, but they’re also written in a way that I’ve found to be more approachable and engaging than the typical philosophical tome.

If you’re interested in thinking more philosophically, but want something a little easier to digest than Heidegger or Hegel, these *might* be for you. At the very least, each of these three books made a meaningful difference in the ways I thought about life and time in 2025.

## [How to Think Like Socrates](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781250280503) by Donald Robertson

In [How to Think Like Socrates](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781250280503), Donald Robertson uses a bit of creative license to weave Plato’s dialogues with well-researched Ancient Greek history, creating a vivid narrative that serves as a wonderful and practical introduction to the life and philosophy of Socrates (and, by extension, Plato as well). What I loved most about this book—as well as Robertson’s earlier work, [How to Think Like a Roman Emperor](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781250621436)—is its pragmatic nature. Robertson is not a philosopher. He’s a cognitive behavioral therapist who draws from Stoicism and Ancient Greek philosophy to provide practical wisdom for facing the many challenges of modern life. This is a book that blends ancient philosophical ideas with useful psychological practices you can immediately start using in day-to-day living, but not in your typical "self help" kind of way.

I enjoyed this book so much that, after reading it, I ended up obsessed with learning more about Socrates, trying to separate historical fact from Plato’s fictional creations. This led me down a rabbit hole to several other books on Socrates, including Plato’s original dialogues, as well as [Open Socrates](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781631498466) by Agnes Callard, and [Socrates: Ironist and Moral Philosopher](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780801497872) by Gregory Vlastos. Both were excellent, but Robertson’s book offers the most value relative to time spent, especially for a anyone new to Socratic thinking.

If you’re looking for an approachable and engaging introduction to Socratic thought, you can’t go wrong with this one.

## [The Unbearable Lightness of Being](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780060932138) by Milan Kundera

Perhaps all works of fiction are, at their essence, philosophical in nature. But few are as beautifully overt in their philosophical pondering as Kundera’s classic. I was sold in the first two pages:

> The heaviest of burdens crushes us, we sink beneath it, it pins us to the ground. But in the love poetry of every age, the woman longs to be weighed down by the man's body. The heaviest of burdens is therefore simultaneously an image of life's most intense fulfillment. The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become.
> 
> Conversely, the absolute absence of a burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into the heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly being, and become only half real, his movements as free as they are insignificant.
> 
> What then shall we choose? Weight or lightness?

As the passage above alludes, the book has a fair amount of sex. That's just Kundera's preferred motif. But at its core, this is not a book about erotic encounters. Rather, it is a meditation on Nietzsche’s “mad myth” of eternal return—the idea that everything recurs as we once experienced it, and that such recurrence recurs for eternity, giving immense weight to every decision, every action we take. Kundera flips this on its head, asking: What if everything occurs only once—if we have only one single, beautiful life to live, such that nothing we do has “weight” to it at all?

There’s a lot to explore in just that one question. But in the latter half of the story, Kundera digs into the “tyranny of kitsch”—the superficial, tasteless, sentimental, and ultimately futile denial of the more unpleasant aspects of human existence. This is what really stuck with me, the “heaviness” of the novel that which now dwells as an eternal thematic recurrence in my own mind. What this says about my own personality, I’m not sure, but I now notice Kundera's “kitsch” everywhere, online especially. Modern culture seems to worship kitsch. After all, we live in the age of social media, and social media is the ultimate kitsch machine.

## [The Scent of Time](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781509516056) by Byung-Chul Han

Few books left their mark on my thinking this past year as much as [The Scent of Time](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781509516056). Han’s ideas made their way into several of my recent essays, and it was *The Scent of Time* that led me to write [Design for lingering](/writing/design-for-lingering/).

What is more human than to ponder the passage of time, or our common failure to perceive its passage? As Proust wrote in *In Search of Lost Time*:

> In theory one is aware that the earth revolves, but in practice one does not perceive it, the ground upon which one treads seems not to move, and one can live undisturbed. So it is with Time in one's life.

This imperceptibility is precisely what Han interrogates. He argues that our modern inability to properly experience time, our collective misbelief that time is somehow “speeding up,” rests in the modern world’s inability to linger with things. *The Scent of Time* makes the case that we have fragmented our time and our life experiences to such a degree that we’ve lost the thread of life itself. Nothing has narrative continuity anymore. Nothing has duration. Everything is a jump from this to that to the next without time to pause and think.

Han’s writing tends to be rather polarizing; people either love it or hate it. The reason for this, from what I can tell, is that Han’s writing isn’t particularly crisp or direct. Each chapter in one of his books feels more like painting a picture with words, often coming at things circuitously, indirectly, vaguely. Basically, it’s a vibe, man. Nevertheless, I feel Han accurately diagnoses the brokenness and dysfunction of modern life in a way no other living philosopher is doing.

Admittedly, this is the most challenging of the three books on my list, but I still believe it’s well worth the challenge.

If any of these find their way onto your reading list in 2026, I'd love to hear what you think.
