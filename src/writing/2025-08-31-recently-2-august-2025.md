August is nearly over, and summer's leisurely mornings have given way to the choreography of the school year. For our family, this means we have returned to spending the earliest hours of the day juggling work commitments while trying to usher a first and third grader out the door, well fed, clothes on, teeth brushed.

A byproduct of my new [analog evenings practice](/writing/habit-experiment-1-analog-evenings/)—or perhaps just the fact that I'm getting older—is that I naturally wake up earlier, often an hour before the household morning-time frenetic energy kicks in. I have been using this quiet morning hour to meditate, prep for the day, and exercise—even though I'm not really a morning exerciser. I honestly prefer to ease into the day with quiet and gentle activities, but I'm giving this a chance because it's easier to be consistent with exercise if you do it first thing.

As a last hurrah before the summer break ended, we visited my parents in San Diego, where we enjoyed sunny beach days, a trip to Balboa Park, and, of course, Legoland. Our kids are young enough that Legoland remains on our San Diego itinerary. While we enjoyed it—flying through "Cloud Cuckoo Land", building Lego race cars, etc.—it has lost some of its luster compared to our first visit two years ago. I'm honestly not sure we'll be back again any time soon.

Outside of work and parenting, I've directed my remaining time and energy to my studies in philosophy (and any adjacent reading). A former colleague and I reconnected over a shared interest in philosophy, and we recently began practicing what he calls "pair reading." He describes it as "pair programming for intellectual exploration." Basically, it's a book club of two people.

For our first book, we are reading Shannon Vallor's [Technology and the Virtues](https://academic.oup.com/book/25951), which is also part of Quest №2 in my [Philosophy for Designers](/notes/philosophy-for-designers/) self-study journey. Since I'm only starting Quest №1 this month, digging into *Technology and the Virtues* means I'm reading this book out of my intended order, slightly ahead of my schedule. But that's fine—my reading list was always meant to serve as a guide, not a prescription.

What I love about pair reading so far is the sharing of different perspectives and reflections on the reading, without the overhead and group dynamics of a book club. It feels more intimate.

## Articles and videos worth your time

Here are a few things I enjoyed reading and watching on the web this past month:

[The Self-Absorbed Bubble of Managerialism](https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/lessons-of-babel/articles/the-self-absorbed-bubble-of-managerialism) is a review of the book [*Fatal Abstraction: Why the Managerial Class Loses Control of Software*](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781324078951), which argues that "the rot in our technology culture is managerialism." Managerialism embraces the idea that general management skills are transferable across industries and organizational cultures—leading to a world where technology is built inhumanely, because the companies that build our technologies are often led by people focused on financial outcomes over all else. I loved this closing reflection on self-driving cars:

>The question of whether we want self-driving cars should turn not on a technocratic calculation of energy consumption or time allocation. Instead, we must ask whether we want to cede the agency, imagination, and judgment required to move ourselves in and through our communities—and indeed our own lives. This is a far different question from how to tweak the products to be “safer.” Rather, it is the more basic question: What kinds of persons do we want to be and what sort of communities do we actually want to live in?

Geoffrey Litt is one of my favorite thinkers in the world of human-computer interaction. I really enjoyed [his recent provocation](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2025/07/27/enough-ai-copilots-we-need-ai-huds.html) that we reexamine the need to turn every AI experience into a "copilot," and instead consider the metaphor of a heads-up display (HUD) instead.

I don't watch much YouTube, but I try to make time for just about anything that [Jared Henderson](https://www.youtube.com/@_jared) produces. If you want simple, approachable, down-to-earth introductions to philosophy, you can't go wrong with his channel. Last month I finally watched his excellent [guide to Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GteRElF533Q). And he recently released an even longer, [in-depth guide to Plato's Republic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAp_POUGgB8), which I have not yet watched, but eagerly added to my queue.

Finally, leave it to the one and only Ethan Marcotte to deliver [a beautiful and scathing critique](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/a-notional-design-studio/), of the Trump administration's new "America by Design" initiative and associated website, a monstrous three megabyte download which, beyond the "tepid" aesthetics, is absolutely riddled with poorly-written copy. But, really, it's the site's work of erasure and exclusion that Marcotte ultimately points to:

>... the authoritarian impulse — to erase histories, to control a narrative, to single-mindedly focus on image and aesthetics — shapes not just the site’s text, but its design as well. Its text erases the history and work of the people who quietly labored to create better digital services for the public; in their place, it proposes that one man alone can define “design” for the country ... All of this should and must be rebuked by the design community; it must also be actively, urgently dismantled.
