The hsiang-yin (香鐘 or, in pinyin, “xiāngzhōng”) is an ancient Chinese timekeeping device first developed during the Song dynasty. Used in China up until the late 19th century, the hsiang-yin (literally “seal of fragrance”) is unlike Western timekeeping devices. It isn't mechanical, and doesn’t measure time in discrete chunks of hours, minutes or seconds. Instead, it measures time through the slow burning of incense. 

In his book [The Scent of Time](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781509516056), Korean philosopher Byung-Chul Han uses this device as a metaphor for exploring alternative, healthier relationships to time. Evoking the smoky, contemplative atmosphere of a room full of burning incense, Han calls for an approach to life that similarly allows time and space for lingering, contemplation, even boredom.

Throughout much of his work—both in *The Scent of Time* and elsewhere—Han often reflects on our sense of smell—a sense which, though relatively underdeveloped in humans, nevertheless requires *duration.* Scents cannot flash before us the way images can, or instantaneously resound in our ears the way sounds do. No, scents *linger* in the air. They are slow; they do not readily dissipate. Consider Han’s reflection on the hsiang-yin, which he calls a device of “fragrant time:”

> As a medium for measuring time, incense differs in many respects from water or sand. Fragrant time does not flow or trickle away. Nothing is emptied. Rather, the scent of the incense fills the room, even turns time into space; it thus gives it a semblance of duration. Although the glow permanently transforms the incense into ash, the ash does not disintegrate into dust.

## The temporal crisis

In *The Scent of Time* Han argues that our modern lives suffer from a “temporal crisis,” a shared sense that time is accelerating out of control, “whizzing by without a direction.” For most of us, this temporal crisis is something we *feel* more than we can easily describe. It is that fleeting disorientation after we wake up from hours flitting about on social media, doomscrolling, wondering where the day went. It is that strange amnesia of a few hours we can’t quite account for after falling down some YouTube rabbit hole, bouncing from video to video. It is our struggle to describe to friends and family the productive use of days spent jumping from Zoom to Zoom, or Slack thread to Slack thread.

Throughout much of modern life we have intentionally “atomized” time, breaking it down into smaller and smaller disjointed increments that have no overall narrative continuity. And it is this atomization, Han argues, that has led to our collective perception that everything is somehow speeding up.

This is easiest to notice in social media. Consider platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Both of these platforms allow us to rapidly consume media experiences in tiny, bite-sized increments that have no relationship beyond their temporal adjacency. Open TikTok, and find yourself immediately greeted by a popular video of some random teenagers acting out a new dance. As soon as the playhead reaches the final second, you will find yourself immediately transported to the next video, perhaps of a cute dog and cat cuddling, or a disturbing clip of a war in a far off land. Tap open Instagram, and once you finish quickly glancing at that photo of our coworker’s beautiful Icelandic vacation, you find yourself mindlessly swiping to the next, this one an image from a close friend’s photos of a recent government protest. 

These unceasing streams of content—rapid-fire visual after visual—are specifically designed to prevent us from engaging in any meaningful reflection or contemplation on their content. They actively prohibit lingering.

Social media isn’t the only culprit here either. Instant messaging and Slack allow us to similarly move unreflectively from conversation to conversation. The web allows us to move from reading experience to reading experience before we’ve had time to fully absorb the words we have read. Even email allows for rapid-fire, unreflective correspondence that, as Han writes, “does not need to conquer mountains and oceans,” abolishing “space itself.”

Han’s philosophy has grown in popularity because he so readily puts his finger on what many of us innately feel about our lives, but also feel helpless to overcome. We *want* duration. We *want* contemplation. When I sit and reflect on my own “ideal day,” for instance, I find that what I seek most is a feeling of lasting, deep flow state. It’s not that my ideal day is devoid of work, but rather that I want it to be characterized by an experience of time as long and deep and meaningful. And I’m not alone in this. This longing for duration is precisely the reason books like [Deep Work](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781455586691) by Cal Newport have become so popular.

## Technologies against the vita contemplativa

Han’s suggested antidote to the temporal crisis lies in cultivating a contemplative life, a *vita contemplativa,* or what he says is simply a willingness to “linger.” Lingering—the ability and desire to sit with our experiences for extended periods—can act as a counterbalancing force against the rapid atomization of time because it allows us to experience real duration. Lingering actively prevents the atomization of time.

While Han does not directly point his finger at modern technology as the cause of our temporal crisis, throughout *The Scent of Time* he repeatedly criticizes how it actively prevents contemplative reflection. For instance, of the Internet and the web he writes:

> The time of internet space is a discontinuous and point-like Now-time. You move from one link to the next, from one Now to another. The Now does not possess duration.

Of email (which I already mentioned above) he writes:

> Electronic mail produces instantaneity by destroying the paths as spatial intervals in their entirety. It dispenses with space itself. Intervals are destroyed in order to produce total proximity and simultaneity.

And of stored “electronic memories” like photo albums he writes:

> Electronic memories and other technological possibilities for recurrence destroy the temporal interval which is responsible for forgetting. They make what is past instantaneously retrievable and available.

Han’s critique of digital media, tools and experiences left me wondering: Does it have to be this way? As Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores [once wrote](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780201112979) (in a quote I’ve grown fond of repeating):

> We encounter the deep questions of design when we recognize that in designing tools we are designing ways of being.

There’s nothing inherent in technology that reinforces the temporal crisis other than how we have chosen to design it. We *could* design things differently.

So, how might we design new digital tools that might encourage a different, healthier relationship to time? How might we design technologies that promote *lingering*?

## Design interventions (and a few caveats)

First, some caveats: I recognize that Han is unlikely to condone the thought experiments that follow. I don’t think he’s likely to suggest that more or different technologies will somehow solve or alleviate the temporal crisis. This whole effort risks seeming solutionist. Most of his philosophy points at the deeper cultural underpinnings of the temporal crisis—something he calls the “positive violence” of our “achievement society.“ And nothing mentioned here will solve this more fundamental cultural problem. Nevertheless, the pragmatist in me believes that there remains value in using the temporal crisis as a lens for exploring new avenues for design. Computational technologies are here to stay, after all, and so it is imperative that we design them in ways that promote human well-being.

To begin, it helps to consider a few apps that already promote healthier relationships with time by encouraging mindfulness, focus and presence. Focused writing tools, for instance, such as [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com) or [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) (the tool in which I’ve chosen to write these very words) offer environments that encourage us to sit with our creative endeavors for long, uninterrupted periods. Similarly, photography apps such as [Hipstamatic](https://www.hipstamatic.app) emulate the experience of shooting on film, in which we cannot instantaneously review the results of our photography, forcing us to stay present in the moment, observant of our surroundings. And modern minimalist hardware such as the [Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com) or [reMarkable tablet](https://remarkable.com), both of which lack web browsers and unfettered Internet access, encourage us to linger on whatever work or experience is directly before us.

Given the examples above, we can easily imagine design interventions for future technologies or products that also encourage a more mindful, present, *lingering* type of experience. 

### Slow release content

We might consider designing platforms that release content slowly, over time, at regular intervals, encouraging contemplative pacing. For instance, imagine a reading app that releases small chunks of a philosophical text over days or weeks, making it impossible to binge-read ahead—forcing you to sit with each chapter for a full day before continuing. Or imagine learning systems that ask us to sit for extended periods of time on a single topic or subject. 

### Depth-over-breadth

Recommendation algorithms often encourage us to jump from topic to topic, or article to article, before we’ve really had time to digest what we just read or watched. We can instead imagine algorithms that actively resist this pattern. We can imagine algorithms that provide recommendations which encourage you to go deeper on a specific topic, or perhaps push you to return to the same works repeatedly instead of endlessly branching out into adjacent topics or unrelated works. Consider a music streaming service, for instance, that encourages you to listen to the same album at least five times before introducing anything new, cultivating the familiarity that transforms casual listening into genuine appreciation.

### Intentional asynchronicity

The speed with which most communication occurs over digital media encourages us to divide our time amongst multiple simultaneous threads. We can push out messages more quickly than we can consume and think about them, which means we inevitably jump around from conversation to conversation. As such, we might consider tools and platforms that deliberately delay responses and interactions, creating more time for deeper reflection. 

Imagine an email client that holds your outgoing messages for an hour, giving you time to reconsider them before sending. Or, how about a messaging app that calculates the geographic distance between correspondents and introduces delays proportional to the time the correspondence would have taken 100 years ago? A message from across town might arrive in an hour; one from across the country, in three days.

## Beyond temporal interventions

While these interventions and examples point us in the right experiential direction—reduced distraction, promotion of focus, temporal spacing—I’m not sure they’d hit the mark.

While Han doesn’t specifically discuss it much in *The Scent of Time,* core to his philosophical project, as described in his other books, is the idea that by over-focusing on our own needs, advancements and personal projects, we have lost sight of the “Other.” That is, we spend too much time thinking about ourselves and not enough cultivating love for, understanding of, and relationships with other people. Han calls this “friendliness,” but it might be better characterized as openness to the world.

Keeping this in mind, we can’t just design technologies that reduce or eliminate distraction if we really want to make any sort of dent in this problem. We need to go further. We would also need to design experiences that encourage care and respect—interventions that move away from optimizing individual experiences towards creating conditions of genuine encounter with other beings.

### Reciprocal engagement

Instead of platforms that promote metrics-driven engagement, or allow for one-sided content sharing, we might imagine ways of promoting more reciprocal engagement. For instance, consider an app that doesn’t show other peoples’ content until you’ve shared your own. Or imagine a discussion platform that enforces a question-to-statement ratio, one that requires every declarative claim be balanced with genuine curiosity about another's perspective.

### Time gifts

Imagine technologies that encourage us to think of time as something we give to others. For instance, consider systems that require “attention pledges” before you can access and review someone’s writing. Would you still read this essay if you were first prompted with: “This piece takes 12 minutes to read thoughtfully. Are you willing to give this time?” Or, rather than gatekeep upfront, imagine systems that share “read receipts” which include the amount of time a person spent with another’s work.

### Shared contemplation

Lastly, we might consider shared spaces that allow us to linger, virtually, together, turning solitary contemplation into a communal experience. Imagine a virtual reading room where you see the images of other readers working through the same book, their pace visible as they turn pages alongside you. Or picture a system that reveals new stories, images or content only when enough people have “gathered” for the telling.

## Spaces for savoring time

I recognize that these ideas seem unusual, and sit uncomfortably alongside commercial realities. Deliberately slowing down engagement is not what most designers have been asked to optimize for. But not every product need embrace these ideas wholesale, and in some cases these ideas might lead to a worse overall experience. Nevertheless, even small gestures towards a more contemplative experience, whether that means opting away from infinite scroll or defaulting away from auto-play, acknowledge that our relationship for time matters. Maybe there's room, even at the margins, to design with lingering in mind.

While I’ve never actually seen a hsiang-yin or tried measuring time by burning a stick of incense, as a long-time practitioner of Zen, I am familiar with the “scent of time” in other, similar ways. My deepest experiences of lingering, relaxed duration have often occurred on long, multi-day silent Zen meditation retreats called “sesshins.” There, in the meditation hall, where the scent of incense hangs in the air and the sound of the bell rings out with precise regularity, time can stretch to an almost painful longevity. Sitting, cross-legged, or perched on a small, wooden bench, forced to simply “be,” undistracted, unproductive, moment to unending moment ... this is the antithesis of the temporal crisis. Deep in sesshin, time is not something we chop up and dole out; it is something we savor.

For me, the Zen meditation hall hints at what more digital spaces might aspire to be: places where we slow down and savor time with others. As I said above, the temporal crisis won't be solved by technology, but perhaps thoughtful design can create small refuges from the whizzing “now,” spaces where true duration becomes possible.
