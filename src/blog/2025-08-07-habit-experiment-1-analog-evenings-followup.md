_Note: This is a follow-up to [an earlier post](/blog/habit-experiment-1-analog-evenings/)._

About a month ago, I began [an experiment in intentional living](/blog/habit-experiment-1-analog-evenings/) I called "analog evenings." The rules of this experiment were simple: Each night, around two hours before bedtime, I would power down—no phone, no computer, no television, nothing with a backlit screen or network connection. What follows is a brief reflection on this experiment, sharing what I learned and exploring whether and how I want to continue practicing this habit.

## The good parts

Unsurprisingly, "analog evenings" had an immediate qualitative positive impact on my life and well-being. I've consistently made time for meditation every evening. I've read more books than I normally would have in a 30-day span. And I've written in my journal more consistently, which has ultimately led me to reflect more deeply on ideas about life and all the philosophy I've been reading with this extra time.

Additionally, and perhaps best of all for my physical well-being, I notice that I have fallen asleep much faster every night since beginning this habit. Historically, I've never been one of those people who immediately drifts off when my head hits the pillow. Occasionally, I have even struggled with intermittent insomnia. So it often takes me 20 or 30 minutes or sometimes more to fall asleep once I'm in bed. But for this entire past month, I'm pretty sure I've fallen asleep within 5 to 10 minutes every single time.

While I could attribute this to reduced evening-time blue light exposure, I believe it's more nuanced than this. I believe the real reason I fall asleep faster is just that my mind is *quieter*. I'm no longer churning on some late-night coding problem. I'm no longer ruminating on some work issue that I was inadvertently reminded about during a quick peek at my calendar. And I'm no longer going to bed having just read or watched *anything* about the current abysmal state of the world.

## The hard parts

That said, maintaining this habit was not without its challenges. 

I'll admit that I *did* look at my phone on occasion during these supposedly sacred phone-free hours. The most common reason for this is that I use my phone as a meditation timer. Since using my phone solely as a meditation timer is in service of the spirit and intention of this habit, I allowed myself this exception. I did, however, notice that I had to intentionally fight the bad habit of jumping into other apps once my meditation was over.

I also found I could no longer work on side projects on my computer in the evening. This includes programming projects, but also working on and maintaining this blog. For writing essays and blog posts, one workaround is to simply draft everything by hand on paper instead of the computer. I haven't tried this yet. For programming projects, I've simply shifted this to the early morning hours and weekends instead.

But perhaps most challenging of all, I was prohibited from sitting and watching the occasional movie in the evening with my wife—something we both enjoy. On the plus side, we did end up spending a lot more time quietly reading together instead.

## The verdict

Given the overwhelming positive benefits practicing this habit, I plan to continue it indefinitely—with a few practical modifications.

I'll allow myself to use my phone for utilitarian purposes, such as timing meditations or dealing with some "smart home" functionality. I'll also allow myself a glance at my calendar when I need to plan for the following day (but no email!) And once or twice a week, it's fine to have a "cheat day" for movie watching or catching up on a new show. That still counts as quality time with family.

## The lesson

If anything, this month-long experiment has taught me that the quality of my evenings profoundly shapes the quality of my sleep, my thinking, and ultimately my days. While I'm fine relaxing some rules to maintain balance, the spirit of the habit remains: to create intentional boundaries around distracting technology in the day's waning hours. 

For me, this isn't about deprivation, it's about reclamation. With this new habit I've found it easier to reclaim time for deeper thought, better rest, and the kind of quiet presence that our always-connected world so easily intrudes upon.
