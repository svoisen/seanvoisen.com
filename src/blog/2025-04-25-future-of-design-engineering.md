In [Figma's not a design tool—it's a Rube Goldberg machine for avoiding code](https://uxdesign.cc/figmas-not-a-design-tool-it-s-a-rube-goldberg-machine-for-avoiding-code-2a24f11add5d), Michael Buckley revives the perennial debate on whether designers should learn to code with this controversial call to action:

>Somewhere, a designer is meticulously adjusting auto-layout settings in Figma — crafting an intricate set of nested components, master variants, and esoteric constraints — all to simulate the behavior of a simple button ... 
>
>If you’re going to spend hours creating intricate simulations in Figma, you might as well put that effort directly into code — because in the end, code is where your designs must ultimately function.

While it is true that code is the medium of software, and it is also true that code is where "designs must ultimately function," I don't agree with the sentiment that all designers should learn to code. But I also don't feel they should be wasting time building elaborate interactive simulations of software inside design tools either. The days of wiring up "noodles" to create prototypes in Figma and other tools are dead. And it isn't because designers are learning how to code. Instead, AI is putting the nail in that coffin.

Here's what I see happening, both across the industry and where I work: Some designers *are* coding, but not in the traditional, time-honored, crack-open-a-book-and-get-typing kind of way. Instead, they're vibe coding. AI-based programming tools like Cursor—tools targeted squarely at the developer market—are also radically disrupting the *design* process. Designers who previously were only drawing pictures of software in Figma have been enabled, through AI, to begin playing in the interdisciplinary space between design and engineering. They are prototyping and making software—not just with visual programming tools, but with AI agents and text-based code. And in the process, some of them are transforming themselves into nascent *design engineers.* 

I find this fascinating, and as a leader in the UX design engineering space, rather exciting. For myriad reasons—from the burdensome maintenance of AI-generated code, to the imprecision of AI-generated edits, to the hallucination of APIs and third-party libraries—it remains to be seen whether AI-based programming tools will really lead to a full step-change in productivity for production software engineers any time soon. But, in the context of design and prototyping, the same limitations that make AI tools challenging to use for production are irrelevant. Prototypes don't need to be maintained, and they typically have few security requirements. They also can be scrapped and re-built over and over again. In fact, the entire purpose of design prototyping is to learn as quickly as possible through rapid exploration, testing and iteration. This is a space well-suited to embrace vibe coding.

But what does all this mean for those of us who have made a career out serving as the bridge between disciplines? What does the use of AI tooling by designers mean for the UX engineers, the design engineers, the design technologists, and other design-engineering hybrids? 

I think it means opportunity.

For the past few months, I've been setting aside time on Fridays for casual conversations with design technologists, UX engineers, design engineers, and a variety of other folks— often students—aspiring to have one of these job titles. We talk about everything from career paths to organizational structure to design collaboration to prototyping strategies. AI is never the first topic of any of these conversations, but I can always sense when it is coming. It is that proverbial elephant in the room who coyly tip-toes from some dark corner to take center stage just before our allotted 30 minutes expires. What do you think about AI? What do you think it means for ... *us*?

I'm not big on gatekeeping. Lowering barriers to entry to programming, and making it easier for more designers jump in and prototype their own ideas is not a bad thing. We *want* to make it easier for designers to move beyond drawing mere pictures of software to making working versions of those same pictures. We *want* them to make prototypes. More prototyping means more testing of designs and, ultimately, better design outcomes and better user experiences.

More prototyping also means better communication with engineering. If a designer is able to move higher up the fidelity spectrum on their own, then it's less likely that things will be lost in translation as engineers implement the design vision in production. Engineers will no longer have to reference only Figma files, where it is sometimes difficult to impossible to convey all the details around application behavior or animation. Instead, they can just play with the working prototype and try it out for themselves, possibly even borrowing the AI-generated code from the prototype to get started.

This frees experienced design engineers to focus on different, more challenging problems, often at faster pace, and in tighter partnership with their design and engineering colleagues. They can radically uplevel their impact.

Designers without much programming knowledge or background can do a lot with AI, but they will still always find themselves hitting a wall in what they can build. Despite the hype around so-called "one-shot" vibe-coding, to be truly facile with AI-based tools you still have to "speak the language" of software engineering and guide the AI agent through a series of steps and decisions. You have to tell it what programming language and frameworks you want to use. You often have to guide it in making decisions around things like API choices, state management, or data persistence technologies. And, most critically, AI often gets things completely wrong, breaks previously working code, or hallucinates non-existing APIs, functions or 3rd-party dependencies. Solving any of this typically requires code literacy and debugging experience. 

Furthermore, [left to their own devices, generative models threaten to homogenize design.](https://seanvoisen.com/blog/vibe-coding-design-homogenization/) The achilles heal of all generative models is that they have been trained on solved problems. This makes them well-suited for quickly scaffolding common UI patterns, creating CRUD interfaces, or generating simple backends that can allow prototypes to work with real data. They are very good at creating facsimiles of pre-existing interfaces and experiences. But this also makes them ill-suited for prototyping many of the aspects of a user experience that will allow your product to truly stand out from the crowd. 

And this is where design engineers come in.

User experience has always mattered, but as software rapidly proliferates—as more people are empowered through AI to rapidly create software—user experience will be the ultimate differentiator. Empowered by the same AI tools that their design colleagues are using to scaffold the basics of an experience or try out a design with real data, design engineers can both collaborate more deeply with their designer colleagues and spend more time focusing on higher-impact user experience problems, often with much greater breadth. And they can be freed to spend more time with production engineering colleagues polishing and elevating the experiences that ship. Whether this means inventing delightful new interaction patterns, creating entire prototypes of new product concepts, nailing a subtle transition or animation, or digging into UI responsiveness optimizations, AI tools mean design engineers can spend less time on scaffolding and plumbing and be far more ambitious and impactful in what they explore and build. That, to me, is exciting.

>The best engineers have always been more than just coders. They've been problem solvers who understand both technical constraints and [human needs](https://x.com/garrytan/status/1870188351028113416). As AI tools reduce the friction of implementation, this holistic understanding becomes even more valuable.

I know of no group of more product-minded, and human-attuned engineers than those people who call themselves "UX engineers" or "design engineers." If AI tools make it easier than ever for more designers to get comfortable with code, to build things with code, and maybe, just maybe, to become nascent design engineers themselves, even better.
