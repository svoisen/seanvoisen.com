Most workday afternoons, I leave my desk, set my Slack status to "away," and take a meandering forty-minute walk around my neighborhood. This open secret between me and my coworkers—a habit I stumbled into a few years ago—has proven immensely beneficial to both my psychological and physical well-being. After a walk I think better, I feel better, and I have more energy. So I treat the brief time I dedicate to walking as sacred, blocking out the time on my calendar and ignoring or disabling notifications on my phone.

I'm certainly not alone in my reverence for ambulatory motion. Walks are, after all, the world's greatest "tool for thought." Thinkers from Aristotle to Einstein have used long walks as a means for improving their thinking and maintaining physical well-being. Cal Newport extolls the virtues of walking in his book [Deep Work](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781455586691). Walking features prominently in nearly all of photographer and essayist [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/)'s work. And it was Søren Kierkegaard who once wrote:

>I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it ... Health and salvation can only be found in motion.

For any serious thinker, walking is indispensable.

I live in California but work with a global team distributed across the Eastern US, Europe, and India. As a result, most of the social activity of my workday—meetings, one-on-ones, emails, Slack messages—is front-loaded during the morning hours. By 2pm things quiet down, the messages slow to a trickle, and I often find I finally have time to sit and think. Strategically placing my walk between these early hours of intense managerial activity and the later hours of deeper, focused work creates a liminal transition zone between my two modes of being. It serves as a means for both clearing my mind and "stirring the pot of ideas" for my more focused afternoon.

A few months ago, as I shut the door to my home and began my usual stroll down the sidewalk of our suburban street, I felt the familiar staccato pulse of my Apple Watch's haptic motor on my wrist. "It looks like you are working out," my watch helpfully noted. A green button appeared with the prompt: Record outdoor workout?

I've recorded my walks and runs for years. My goal—as is the goal of many Apple Watch wearers—is to "close my rings," meaning that I want to ensure that I complete and record a set number of active minutes, calories burned, and hours standing each and every day. And, at this point in my life, I know the data that is gathered through all this automated recording rather intimately. I know my usual walking heart rate, how high my heart rate peaks on certain inclines along my normal routes, my average walking pace, how many miles I usually cover, even the overall trend of my VO2 max.

Mindlessly, I moved to tap the button. But then I caught myself, my finger hovering over the watch face. Did I *really* need to record this walk? Wasn't the act of recording completely antithetical to my original purpose for walking in the first place? What if I just ... walked?

Digital privacy advocates often decry gadgets like the Apple Watch as technologies of surveillance. Apple Health amasses vast amounts of sensitive personal medical data including the heart rate trends just mentioned, but also sleep patterns, blood oxygen readings, heart rate variability data, ECG data, even data capturing how often the wearer has been exposed to loud environments. Without strong privacy and security protections, all this data represents a massive risk to both Apple and its customers. And even with such protections, the collection of such data requires a high degree of trust in Apple from its customers.

But the Apple Watch is equally a technology of [*sousveillance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sousveillance)—a tool we use to monitor and surveil *ourselves*. Data collection isn't just a risk to our privacy. It also transforms how we perceive and value the very thing we are measuring.

Proponents of the [quantified self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self) movement are apt to point out that there is value in the self-monitoring and measurement of personal activities. If you are trying to form a new beneficial habit—say regular running or meditation—tracking your "streaks" of regular activity helps to build up new habitual muscle. If you have specific fitness goals—say, the desire to run a marathon—it can be helpful to track the duration and length of your runs as you build towards the big event. But sousveillance technologies—whether they are sophisticated watches manufactured by giant tech corporations or just homemade paper-based habit trackers—can also serve as a Trojan Horse for a kind of overzealous productivity-oriented mindset that threatens to cheapen the value of the very activity you are trying to measure.

## The imp of the perverse

[The Imp of the Perverse](https://poestories.com/read/imp) is a strange and macabre short story by Edgar Allan Poe that explores the human tendency to indulge in perverse and self-destructive impulses. The story begins as a long and meandering confessional essay written by an unknown narrator who, after waxing poetic on topics ranging from phrenology to the nature of perverseness, eventually admits to murdering a man in order to inherit his estate. This narrator gets away with his crime for many years, but after a while he begins to quietly obsess with the idea of confessing to his sins. Over time, the force of this obsession builds and builds—as if a devious imp were sitting on his shoulder urging him to act against his own best interests—until, eventually, he can no longer help himself. He blurts out a confession in a "passionate hurry," and is swiftly sentenced to death.

The brilliance of the "Imp of the Perverse" lies in Poe's realization that we can sabotage our own interests through excessive self-consciousness. That is, hyper-awareness—paying too much or too close of attention to something—can sometimes work to our detriment. In the case of the narrator in Poe's story, it is his excessive focus on his own thoughts of what he should *not do* that leads to his hasty confession and ultimate demise. But tools of measurement can also nudge us towards unhealthy compulsive hyper-awareness as well.

About four years ago I suffered through several months of extreme insomnia. What started as a single night of poor sleep turned into another night of poor sleep, and then another, and another. Soon, I found myself trapped in a strange, self-perpetuating cycle of seemingly unending wakefulness. Some nights I only managed to eke out 2 or 3 hours of sleep. Occasionally, on those darkest nights when the passing seconds seemed to tick infinitely onward, and time stretched painfully into the void of non-time, I didn't sleep at all. Weeks passed by shrouded in a strange fog of fatigue, like permanent jet lag.

My problem of insomnia quickly became an obsession, something I spent much of my waking hours (and I had a lot of them) trying to solve. I read research papers. I tried out different sleep hygiene routines. I tried various supplements. I slept in different parts of the house. I enrolled myself in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). I rigorously tracked my diet and my sleep in a journal and on my phone. None of it worked.

It wasn't until I discovered the work and writings of [Daniel Erichsen](https://www.thesleepcoachschool.com/) that I realized the vicious circularity of my problem: my obsession with solving my insomnia was perpetuating it. Paradoxically, I needed to do nothing. I needed to stop paying attention to and trying to optimize my sleep. 

Erichsen's key insight about insomnia is that for many insomnia sufferers—including myself—the condition operates as a phobia. Specifically, it results from a fear of *not falling asleep*. This fear can develop spontaneously, usually after a few nights of poor sleep which quickly spiral out of control. At bedtime, someone with this phobia is prone to think: "Oh no! Here we go again, another night without rest and another miserable day ahead." But even this simple, self-defeating thought can cause a flood of stress hormones like cortisol to rush through the body, creating a response of hyper-arousal, which ultimately prevents the insomnia sufferer from falling asleep. The failure to sleep perpetuates the cycle, strengthening the fear response, thereby exacerbating the problem, ad infinitum. It is only by *accepting* the fact that it is OK to lie in bed awake, by letting go and *not* paying attention to the supposed problem, that it can eventually be allowed to subside on its own.

Tracking and measuring my sleep, both through paper-based data collection and through technological means like wearing my Apple Watch to bed, was not doing me any favors. As Erichsen says in one of his books, I needed to stop being "attached to the outcome" when it came to my sleep. I needed to just let sleep be sleep.

And this is what I realized about walking too. I needed to just let my walks be walks.

## The imp of optimization

Poe published "The Imp of the Perverse" in 1850. Nearly two centuries later, we now live in a society where excessive self-consciousness is arguably a bigger problem. Modern culture constantly exhorts us to do more and be more. We are now, as [philosopher Byung-Chul Han describes it](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780804795098), part of an "achievement society," a society that tells us we can be anything we want to be, as long as we focus on constantly improving and optimizing ourselves. This shift has birthed a new kind of imp: "The Imp of Optimization."

Whereas the Imp of the Perverse exhorts us to do that which we know we should not do, the Imp of Optimization implores us to do exactly the opposite: to do even *more* of what we have been told we should already be doing. 

If you look around, you will find imps of optimization everywhere. They are made manifest in the technology we use every day. These imps are the reminder notifications for our todo lists. They are the unread message counts on our myriad inboxes. They are the hustle culture YouTube videos extolling the virtues of 4am morning routines. They are the personal knowledge management advocates writing newsletters about their "second brain." And they are the Apple Watches reminding us to record every bit of exertion or physical activity.

Some might argue that the simple act of recording a walk as a workout on a smart watch doesn't really take anything away from the experience of walking itself. They might say, "What's the big deal?" and tell me to simply tap the button, ignore my watch from that point onwards, and get on with my life. But months of experience *not recording* my walks now tells me otherwise. Even something as small as knowing I'm collecting data leads to subtle shifts in my approach and attitude towards walking. It transforms the walk from a ritual into a task.

I walk to think. I walk to take a break. I walk to get away from my computer, to see the world outside, to take in fresh air, to feel the warmth of the sun on my skin, and to listen to the chirping of the birds. I derive joy in walking precisely because it is not an activity I *have* to do, something I need to check off my list, something to track, or something I need to optimize. It is, as I said, a ritual. And the purpose of a personal ritual is the ritual itself. It is an anchoring in time and space, a means of enriching lived experience through savoring and presence. It is not to be optimized away.

## Ignoring the imps

Every day the imps of optimization whisper seductively: measure this, track that, finish this, optimize all the things. But the perfectly optimized life exists beyond a horizon that recedes as we approach it—there's always another metric to track, another improvement to make. Instead of chasing this impossible goal, maybe we can cultivate a counterbalancing skill: the ability to discern between that which requires optimization and that which deserves reverence. 

Some activities—work projects, athletic training, learning new skills—genuinely benefit from measurement and improvement. But others—walking, sleeping, reading, meditation, meals with family and friends—perhaps these are things to be savored. And if so, we should hold them sacred. We should allow walks to remain unmeasured wanderings, meals to be consumed without photographic evidence, books to be read mindfully and without hurry.

In a culture obsessed with achievement and self-optimization, this might be the most countercultural act possible: to leave some things unmeasured, untracked, unoptimized, unpublicized. 

All the while, the imps will keep whispering.
