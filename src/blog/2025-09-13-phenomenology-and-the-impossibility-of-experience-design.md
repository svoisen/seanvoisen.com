Let's consider a simple scenario involving two completely different people using the exact same banking app on identical iPhones. The first person is walking down a busy street on their way to work, frantically trying to figure out why they suddenly have a bunch of fraudulent charges on their account, desperately seeking customer support information but their phone is low on battery and keeps losing service. The second person is sitting at home on a Sunday morning, leisurely sipping a cup of coffee, moving money from their checking account into an ever-growing savings cushion. While both of these people are using the same app, viewing the same user interface, exploring the same information architecture, and are even using identical hardware, they are having *vastly* different experiences.

This scenario raises a potentially uncomfortable question for anyone in the user experience (UX) design profession: if we can't 100% control the actual experience someone will have with our designs, what does it actually mean to design experiences?

When you think about it, it's a bit strange that we call designers of digital products and services "user experience designers" anyway. The names of other design professions point directly at the worldly artifacts they help imagine and produce. A graphic designer designs *graphics*. An interior designer designs the *interiors* of living and workspaces. A fashion designer designs *fashion.* A set designer designs sets. But those of us who design digital things—whether manifested visually on a screen, or perhaps ambiently in electronic devices—we design *experiences.*

I would venture to guess, however, that few UX designers are under any delusion that anyone can 100% *design* an experience. We know, intuitively, that experiences are products of our consciousness. And we have a vague sense that experiences are not "out there" in the world. They are not something we can objectively point to, and are not something we can just independently create. Instead, we co-create them *with* our world. And how we co-create them depends significantly not just in the artifacts with which we interact, but also a multitude of other contingent factors, including our mood, our environment, our intentions, our current preoccupations, and even our physical capabilities.

Experiences are thus *subjective.* And so, in designing experiences, what we actually design are the digital and physical conditions that might help bring about a certain lived feeling and state of affairs in the consciousness of the user. We design experiential possibilities.

But is there more to it than this? If we look more deeply at what experience actually is, might this inform and improve the practice of experience design? Could we learn to better wield the tools we have at our disposal in influencing experiences? Could we make smarter choices—both experientially and ethically—in how we design those experiential possibilities? And could we, perhaps, become better experience designers as a result?

These are some of the first questions I want to explore in this series on [Philosophy for Designers](/blog/introducing-philosophy-for-designers/). So, I am beginning our journey by digging into the foundations of something called "phenomenology."

## Introducing phenomenology

Phenomenology, as the name implies, is simply the study of "phenomena"—that is, how things appear to us in consciousness. Phenomenology is the school of philosophy concerned with studying and understanding subjective, conscious experience. For designers interested in how philosophy can be practically applied to craft, I feel this is a great place to start.

While none of the essays in this Philosophy for Designers series will presuppose that you have read—or are currently reading—*any* of the books in [my reading list](/notes/philosophy-for-designers/), if you're following along, for this first set of essays I am primarily drawing from my reading of Robert Sokolowski's [Introduction to Phenomenology](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780521667920).

The literature on phenomenology and its relation to technology—specifically the philosophy of technology—is rich and varied. Sokolowski's book, however, does not discuss technology at all. Rather, it is intended to be an introduction to "pure" phenomenology, which means I'll have to do some work here to show how it's relevant to the practice of design. But I'm starting with this book anyway because I really want to build a foundation on theoretical basics before moving onto specific thinkers and works that build upon phenomenological foundations.

What I appreciate about Sokolowski's book is that he avoids extensive references to prior books or other philosophical thinkers. Sure, he mentions other philosophers like Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger in passing, but he explains everything about phenomenology in his own words. This means the *Introduction to Phenomenology* truly functions as an approachable beginning to phenomenology. It's not an easy read, but at least Sokolowski starts from ground zero. He explains everything from first principles. And he resists much of the mind-bending, opaque language you'll find if you go straight to original sources, such as reading Husserl or Heidegger. (Though we will get to them!)

As I mentioned, what Sokolowski doesn't do is make any attempt to relate philosophy to design or technical practices. Extrapolating the value of all this seemingly high-minded theorizing into the everyday work of design will be my job here and throughout the series.

## Consciousness is a relationship, not a thing

The first thing Sokolowski tells us about conscious experience is something so obvious it seems hardly worth mentioning: we are always conscious *of* something. In phenomenology, this is called intentionality or *intending*. To intend is to have a conscious relationship with an object. When we have an experience, it is always an experience *of* something (or in phenomenological terms, we *intend* that thing). This could be an object, such as perceiving or feeling a tree or a telephone, but it could also be something non-physical, such as a recalling a memory or diving deep into our own imaginations. In phenomenology, even these purely psychological phenomena are treated as real things.

If this meaning of the word "intend" seems strange compared to our usual understanding of "to have as one's purpose or plan," this is because its phenomenological use derives from the original Latin use of the word. In Latin, *intendere* meant to direct or stretch towards something. So, according to phenomenology, we always direct or stretch our conscious attention towards something in the world.

What Sokolowski says is that while this seems trivial, it is actually profound. The doctrine of intentionality runs counter to nearly four-hundred years of philosophical thinking that started with the philosopher René Descartes. Sokolowski doesn't go deep into the history of philosophy in his book, but I think it's worth briefly mentioning the historical background, and explaining how phenomenology differs from other schools of thought. This will be relevant because we are not used to thinking phenomenologically in everyday design practice. So understanding how phenomenology runs counter to historical ways of thinking (in the West) about mind and body may help in recognizing our own philosophical biases when and where those show up in design work.

## A brief detour: What Descartes got wrong

You may be familiar with Descartes for his famous proclamation: *Cogito ergo sum*, commonly translated as "I think, therefore I am." In 1637, Descartes first published the French version of this pithy proclamation as part of his *Discourse on Method*. Descartes was a dissatisfied with what he believed was as a millennia-old problem in the Western tradition that started with Aristotle, namely that all human knowledge relied too heavily on unreliable sensory information and common sense reasoning. Descartes thought this just wasn't good enough, that it was too fallible, and insufficiently indubitable for building our entire system of knowledge upon.

So Descartes engaged in an exercise of deep, systemic doubt in order to reach what he hoped would be a new, unshakable foundation for all human knowledge. He doubted everything that he could possibly conceive of doubting: his senses, of course, but also the truth of mathematics, the reality of the world, and even the possibility of an invisible, malevolent demon trying to deceive him into believing in the world in the first place. (Yeah, he got pretty creative in his doubting.) The ultimate result of his exercise in radical doubt was his realization of the one indubitable fact that if he is thinking, he must therefore exist.

With his single dictum, however, Descartes initiated a centuries-long trend in philosophical thinking that bifurcated body and mind into two distinct entities. Building upon this one first principle, Descartes declared that the mind exists only as a purely encapsulated "cabinet" or "sphere" of reasoning apart from the body, calling the mind the *res cogitans* (thinking thing) and the physical universe the *res extensa* (extended thing). Under this Cartesian model of the mind, the mind creates internal representations of sensory impressions, upon which it then reasons about and tries to understand. In this way of thinking, our conscious experience is not *of* anything real at all, but only of our mental representations of more real things that exist outside our mind.

More than two hundred years later, Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology refuted Descartes. He claimed that mind and consciousness are not a separate "things" from the rest of the world. Rather, he argued that consciousness is the domain where our sense of world and other objects arise. As such, the things that present themselves in our consciousness—i.e. phenomena—are real and worthy of study in themselves. They are not mere representations. That is, a phenomenon is not some second-rate copy of something more real that exists outside us; it *is* our subjective reality.

Phenomenology thus brings our shared world of experience into the fore. It provides a philosophical grounding for examining our collective, shared experiences, and outright denies the entire idea of any kind of mind-body split. As Sokolowski writes:

>Phenomenology shows that the mind is a public thing, that it acts and manifests itself out in the open, not just inside its own confines. Everything is outside. The very notions of an "intramental world" and an "extramental world" are incoherent; they are examples of what Ezra Pound calls "idea-clots."

If all this still seems rather high-minded and theoretical, let's get into how this impacts the work of design and why the phenomenological concept of intentionality is so valuable in design thinking.

## Appearances are the real medium of experience

The first reason phenomenology proves useful in design practice is because, as Sokolowski states, "it deals so well with the problem of appearances." By appearances, Sokolowski means phenomena of all kinds—sense impressions, memories, imaginings, and so forth. But an important subset of such appearances aspects of the things we interact with on a daily basis, including the digital tools and services that experience designers are tasked with designing.

Of course, experience designers swim in the world of appearances—in images and words, in media and graphics, in animations and video, in ways of displaying or presenting appearances of all kinds. The work of experience design often entails sensibly organizing, portraying, calling forth and dismissing, these multitudes of "appearances." 

And the reason phenomenology deals so well with appearances is precisely because it takes them seriously. It treats them as worthy of study and understanding, and thus offers a rich theoretical framework with which to make use of them. Sokolowski writes:

>Pictures, words, symbols, perceived objects, states of affairs, other minds, laws, and social conventions are all acknowledged as truly there, as sharing in being and as capable of appearing according to their own proper style.

For designers, this realness of appearances offers a powerful lens for understanding problems of design. In analyzing the multitudinous ways in which things appear to us—and in which we *intend* them—we can take a more experientially-centered approach to design, and discover where we might have blind spots in understanding experiences. As we will see later in Sokolowski's book, phenomenology offers specific tools for better examining appearances that we can leverage in design work. These include the structural forms of phenomenology such as "parts and wholes", "presence and absence" and "identity in manifold." 

## Users create their own meaning

The doctrine of intentionality also tells us that every user approaches a design with their consciousness already directed toward particular goals, contexts, or meanings. This helps us better understand why we cannot fully design experiences—a person's consciousness is already oriented towards some specific thing, and that thing may not be (and is likely not) the interaction with the designed thing itself. Instead, the user probably has some other goal in mind, some imagined future, some challenging problem, or some desired state of affairs.

The work of design, then, includes reminding ourselves about what the user is actually intending. This might entail moving beyond demographic design methodology such as leaning on user personas. For instance, it invites us to explore questions like "What is the essential structure of this type of conscious engagement?" If we return to our banking app scenario, instead of asking "What do 18-24 year old college students need from a banking app?" we might ask "What is the lived experience of financial anxiety or economic security?"

Additionally, intentionality means that users create their own meanings based on what they consciously intend. Experience and meaning emerge from the relationship between consciousness and objects. Our consciousness doesn't just passively receive pre-designed meanings from the outside world; instead it actively creates meaning based on its relationship with what appears to it.

As designers, we can provide certain affordances, visuals, features, and information structures in order to try and bring about a certain experiential quality, but each person's consciousness synthesizes all we provide into its own unique, meaningful experience. The designer of the banking app can do all they want to try and make the experience feel secure, easy-to-use and trustworthy (as we would want in a banking app) but they cannot directly create the experience of trust or security itself.

This understanding allows designers to better focus on what they do have control over, the conditions and invitations of experience that work with structures of consciousness. These include things such as temporal flow (how we experience time), horizons of meaning (the different ways in which we bring meaning into experiences), and embodied engagement (how we experience our body). 

## Next steps

So where does all this leave us so far? Understanding phenomenological intentionality—that users always bring their consciousness _to_ something rather than passively receiving our designs—fundamentally shifts how we approach our work. Rather than focus on trying to design experiences—which is essentially impossible—we instead focus on designing the conditions that allow for certain experiences to emerge.

In the next few essays, I'll first explain Sokolowski's descriptions of the so-called structural forms of phenomenology—parts and wholes, presence and absence, identity in manifolds. Then, we'll dig into phenomenology's explanation of the experience of time, meaning-making, and our embodied, lived experience. Through all of this, I'll attempt to show how each of these seemingly abstract concepts can become practical tools in a growing, philosophically-grounded design toolkit.
