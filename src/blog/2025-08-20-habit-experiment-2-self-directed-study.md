In [The Pleasures of Reading in an Age of Distraction](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780199747498), Alan Jacobs suggests that one of the best ways to choose what to read is to practice what he calls "reading at Whim." Whim (note the capital-W), Jacobs argues, is fundamentally different than regular old whim. Here's how he describes it:

> It helps us to make a vital distinction between what I shall call whim and Whim. In its lower-case version, whim is thoughtless, directionless preference that almost invariably leads to boredom or frustration or both. But Whim is something very different: it can guide us because it is based in self-knowledge—it can become for us a gracious Swiss pedagogue of the mind.

[I've written about this topic before.](/blog/read-at-whim/) For most of my adult life, I've chosen what books to read in my leisure hours based on Whim. And I've found this has served me surprisingly well, allowing me to follow my interests and curiosity towards a wide variety of authors and topics, often guided by whatever happens to be going on in my life at the time.

Indeed, if you're a naturally curious person, reading at Whim happens to be an excellent strategy for reading broadly and avoiding any kind of boredom. In fact, one of Jacobs' rules of Whim is that you should abandon any book you find doesn't engage you. There are, after all, more good books in existence than one could possibly consume in a lifetime. So, if the book you're reading isn't for you, and you've honestly given it a fair chance, move on.

Recently, however, my daughter came into my home office and looked up at all the books on my bookshelf. "Daddy," she asked, "why do you have so many books that you haven't even read?!"

I laughed. She wasn't wrong.

I often jest that I'm a happy practitioner of the Japanese art of [tsundoku](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44981013). Book ownership is the one area of my life where I fail miserably in adhering to any sort of minimalist philosophy. I grew up in a house filled with books, so I like to believe this is a character flaw I inherited from [my father](https://insidepersonalgrowth.com).

By many peoples' standards, I don't actually actually own a lot of books. But, of the books I do own, I've probably read only about 70% of them. And of that 70%, I can't even admit to reading each book in its entirety. This is intentional. I like cultivating a "home library," which I believe must include an inventory of unread books awaiting future serendipitous re-discovery. I'm not alone in this. In [Reading Well](https://map.simonsarris.com/p/reading-well), Simon Sarris describes a similar personal philosophy:

> You should buy books on a whim, whenever possible, enough that you start to forget about them. You shouldn't know the whole contents of your own shelves. If you create a home library it should act as one: It is there for you to discover and rediscover, to get lost in.

That said, as much as I'd like to keep spending money spontaneously on (mostly used) books, lately I've realized that I would like to cultivate deep understanding of some very specific topics and subjects. And reading at Whim will not help me achieve this goal. Whim, after all, is about breadth, not depth. So, I'm going to have to get more intentional.

Over a month ago I shared that I'm starting [a new practice in experimenting with new habits and ways of living](/blog/habit-experiment-1-analog-evenings/). This new practice strikes me as a perfect method for exploring reading at depth and figuring out whether I am going to stick with it. 

So, that leads me to my second life habit experiment, a practice I'm calling, simply, "self-directed study."

## The experiment

For at least 60 days, I plan to follow a reading list from an autodidactic "syllabus" that I have created for myself. The books in this reading list all center on a few specific subjects, and they build on each other in sequence in a way that I hope will help me develop additional mastery in what I want to learn. Admittedly, most of the topics I plan to study are topics I have visited before, many of them over a decade ago in graduate school, but I want to revisit some of them for reasons I plan to elucidate in a follow-up post.

Reading alone won't suffice for reaching my goal, which as I've stated is mastery. I'll need to do more. I'll need to take notes, reflect on the text, and write about what I'm reading.

So, as part of this experiment I'm committing to _learning in the open_ and writing brief essays reflecting on each text, which I will publish here.

## The challenges

The most obvious challenge with this habit lies in the fact I'm signing myself up for *work*. I'm trading in my precious few hours of leisurely reading time for challenging self-study. Sometimes, during these hours, I likely won't find myself reading at all, but instead combing through my notes, synthesizing, thinking, and, ultimately, writing. I fully anticipate there will be times when I just don't want to do it—I'm not doing this for a degree!—so I'll have to push past the initial resistance.

Because this experiment leaves little time for "pleasure reading," I plan to abandon pleasure reading entirely for the duration. This may also feel decidedly "un-fun," but I'm optimistic that the topics and books I've chosen will hold my interest and excitement enough that I won't mind nor notice. They should be pleasurable in and of themselves, albeit in a different way.

## The commitment

I will be starting this experiment in early September. As part of it, I'll share my syllabus and more context about why I've chosen to study the topics I've chosen.

At least every two weeks I will write a short essay reflecting on the readings and sharing it here. I'm hopeful that a few of you readers might choose to follow along.

In the meantime, my daughter's question about all those unread books sitting on my shelves keeps coming back to me. Maybe after these 60 days, I'll have a better answer for her—not about why I own books I haven't read, but about the different ways we grown-ups can read and grow and learn even outside of school. Sometimes we collect possibilities, surrounding ourselves with potential knowledge like seeds waiting for the right season. Other times we till a single plot intensively, going deep rather than broad.

The books on my shelf will wait. They're patient that way. And when I return to reading at Whim, I'm hopeful I'll approach them differently—with new questions, new connections, and perhaps a new appreciation for the creative tension between wandering and discipline.
