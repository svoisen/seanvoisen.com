One of the defining characteristics of what it means to be human—perhaps the thing that sets us most apart from the rest of the animal kingdom—is that we are tool makers. We humans make technology. And the technology we make, in turn, often *makes us.* This reciprocal shaping between humans and our tools is well known and often commented upon. For instance, in [Understanding Computers and Cognition](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780201112979), computer scientists Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores write:

>We encounter the deep questions of design when we recognize that in designing tools we are designing ways of being.

Father John Culkin, a friend of media theorist Marshall McLuhan, made a similar observation when he coined the now famous aphorism:

>We shape our tools and then our tools shape us.

Likewise, Sherry Turkle, in [Evocative Objects](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262516778/evocative-objects/), argued that our tools and our most precious possessions often reshape how we think, writing:

>We think with the objects we love; we love the objects we think with.

If designing tools truly is akin to designing objects of "love" and "ways of being," then it seems imperative that we think deeply about the things we design, and take great care in deciding how we bring them forth into the world. The question is: How can we do this? Or, more importantly, how can we do this *better*?

In the world of computer software, we often look to the practice of user experience design to help answer these questions. UX designers draw from a great number of other fields and disciplines to help them navigate the complex challenges of designing digital experiences—psychology, cognitive science, graphic design, and anthropology, just to name a few. The joy and power of UX design lies in its immensely interdisciplinary nature. Yet, in most conversations about design there is one field that seems to be conspicuously absent. Surprisingly, it is also the field that might be most relevant for helping us navigate the challenges designers face in the era of AI. That field, of course, is **philosophy**.

Which brings me to why I'm writing this post. A little over a week ago [I announced](/blog/habit-experiment-2-self-directed-study/) that I plan to begin a new experiment in self-directed study. Now, I'm happy to share the topic of my studies, something I'm calling: [Philosophy for Designers: Ethics, Experience and Cognition](/notes/philosophy-for-designers/).

I'll get into the specifics of what *Philosophy for Designers* is all about, but first I hope you'll indulge me in a brief digression.

Back in 2008, I enrolled in an interdisciplinary graduate program at the University of California at Irvine called "Arts Computation Engineering," often abbreviated as ACE. ACE blended computer science with electrical engineering, art practice, and critical theory, creating a unique academic environment for thinking deeply and critically about contemporary technologies. If you were to visit our campus back then, you'd likely find our tiny cohort—there were only six of us!—hidden away in a maze of workshops and dilapidated trailers behind UC Irvine's science library. There, in our little maker space, we engaged in a wide variety of both hands-on and intellectual activities—from soldering circuit boards to welding sheet metal to reading philosophy papers to debating theories of social constructivism. 

What I loved most about ACE was its emphasis on *praxis*. By praxis, I mean the conscious application of theoretical ideas towards skilled action. This is primarily what ACE was all about—learning through doing. We didn't simply flap our mouths in ivory-tower debates of high minded theory, and we weren't solely focused on the often messy, hands-on production of art or electronic objects either. Instead, our work was about the interplay between these two ways of being—it was deeply embodied. Indeed, [Simon Penny](https://simonpenny.net/home.html), my thesis advisor and creator of the ACE program, strictly shunned any sort of Cartesian dualist separation between practices of mind and body. He also often reminded us: "The difference between practice and theory is often greater in practice than in theory." And the only way of figuring out that difference was to *do things*.

And, boy, did some of the people in this program do some interesting things. One of our graduates designed and built the famous Rube Goldberg machine [featured in a music video for the band OK Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w). (He also built one for Stephen Colbert.) One built [a cockroach-controlled mobile robot](https://www.conceptlab.com/roachbot/). Another went on to professionally build sculptures using ferrofluid. I, on the other hand, boringly returned to making software.

After I earned my master's degree, Simon encouraged me to pursue a PhD, but I didn't stick around in academia because I wanted to focus on making things. ACE was unique in this respect—it encouraged us to produce artifacts and practice a craft—but I noticed that in the academic world this is the exception rather than the rule. Most of academia was unlike ACE; it didn't encourage production. So I left.

Yet, working in industry, I've often found the situation to be skewed in the inverse—lots of practice and very little theory. We design and we build many things, but we don't talk enough about the hidden assumptions, ideas, and unspoken theories that inform our work. Or when we do, those conversations tend to be only surface level, lacking the depth and richness I so much enjoyed in grad school. 

The challenges around this come to the fore when we are forced to wrestle with the ethical implications of design, as is often the case when designing for AI. But even beyond ethics, design conversations also benefit from a philosophical perspective when wrestling with problems of human experience itself, such as what we mean when we talk about things like "invisible" interfaces, or why designing for something like system breakdown is so damn hard.

Lately, I have found myself—steeped in a world of practice—pining for more theoretical insights and conversation. So, I thought, why not try and mine the rich world of philosophical literature for myself, and invite you, dear reader, along on the journey.

[Philosophy for Designers](/notes/philosophy-for-designers/) aims to explore theoretical foundations for designing digital technologies that honor both human experience and human values. It draws from two philosophical traditions that often stay in separate corners: phenomenology (the philosophy of lived experience) and ethics (the study of right action). Additionally, it sprinkles in a bit of cognitive science from the collection of theories known as [4E cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4E_cognition). Through works spanning philosophy, design theory, cognitive science, and technology criticism, my goal is to develop a theoretical toolkit for the design of technology that's both deeply human and genuinely humane.

I'm reluctant to call this whole thing a "course." Rather, I think of it more as a personal *journey* composed of a series of "quests." Each quest focuses on a specific subdomain. I'll start with a set reading list, but as I make my way through a quest I may find I need to course-correct, or take off on some side quest to understand some unforeseen topic I need to grasp the bigger picture. I suppose what I'm saying here is that it is all subject to change.

I've posted [my guide to Philosophy for Designers in the notes section of my site](/notes/philosophy-for-designers/). I'll be updating it periodically as I go along, and as I promised, I will write and publish regular essays inspired by what I read and learn. 

My first quest focuses on the foundations of phenomenology as it relates to technology and design. I've chosen to start with phenomenology because before we can design better tools, we need to understand how humans actually experience technology in the first place. Phenomenology offers us something crucial here: it shows us that technology is never neutral. Instead, our tools fundamentally alter how we perceive, act in, and make sense of our world. So, to start, I'll be reading thinkers like Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Yuk Hui and Hubert Dreyfus. Some of these people and their ideas are already familiar to me from my graduate studies, but much of it will be new territory. 

If you're a designer or a technologist interested in reading along with me, please [let me know](/about/)—I'd be happy to create opportunities and forums for discussion if there's enough interest. For now, however, [the reading list is set](/notes/philosophy-for-designers/), the questions are clear, and the journey begins.
