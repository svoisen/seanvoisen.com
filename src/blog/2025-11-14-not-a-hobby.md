The first time I met Evan was on move-in day at UCLA. I was quietly unpacking in my third-floor dorm room when he burst through the doorway, waved his hands, and loudly enquired of me and my other roommates: “Do you guys play StarCraft?” The year was 1999, and we were all computer science majors. Of course we did. And so, from that bold and unorthodox introduction we forged an immediate friendship born of video games and a shared interest in computers. We ended up living together for the next three years.

The thing about growing older is that it’s easy to lose track of the friends you made during your youth. Interests change, lives diverge, people move across the country, and before you know it, a decade can pass by almost imperceptibly. The last time I saw Evan was at his wedding over ten years ago. We’re now both in our mid-forties. In the time since I last saw him, I’ve also married, and we have both started families. We now have children old enough to do math homework, read novels, and give us both plenty of attitude.

A little over a month ago, I took a four-day trip to New York City for work, and while I was there I managed to spend an evening with Evan. We met up on the afternoon of a nearly-perfect, cloudless day in early autumn. The late-September sun sat low in the sky, and had that incandescent hue which suggested sweater weather was just around the corner. On that particular day, however, it was still warm enough to wander around the city in a T-shirt, so we rented a few Citi bikes and rode around Central Park before dinner.

As we were pedaling around, trying our best to avoid other cyclists and the occasional wayward pedestrian, Evan asked me: “What are you doing for a hobby these days?”

Now, if he had asked me this question six months or a year ago, I might have excitedly enumerated the various side-projects and generative art pieces I was working on. Depending on the time of year, I could have talked about baking bread, learning the programming language Go, maybe waxed eloquent on the evenings I was spending messing around with my pen plotter. I could have shared the RSS reader I was building, or the Python library I had written for creating isometric line drawings. Like me, Evan is a software engineer; he wouldn’t have second-guessed any of these nerdy hobbies. But, the truth is, for the past few months I have not been doing any of these things. I have not been baking bread. I have not written any code outside of work. And my pen plotter sits on a shelf, collecting dust.

As any parent knows, when you have kids and you work full-time, you are lucky to have enough spare time for one hobby. Or, at least, you probably *should* have only one hobby at a time, lest you choose to neglect household chores, parental responsibilities, school volunteer activities, time with your spouse, or any number of the myriad other things life demands of you in your particular familial role and its attendant duties. For the past few months, my hobby—or at least what I’ve elected to do with my scant spare time—has been so new, so fragile in its infancy, I’ve been reluctant to call it a “hobby” at all.

As we climbed a gradual incline, the weight and inefficiency of my squeaky rental bike became increasingly apparent. I paused for a moment, debating what to say, but without the constant energy of my incessant pedaling, I rapidly decelerated. Evan continued coasting forward, and we were no longer facing each other. Unsure of exactly how to respond, I decided I might as well just share the closest thing to a “hobby” I currently had. Trying to catch up, I rapidly resumed pedaling, and between labored breaths I sheepishly blurted out: “Reading philosophy!”

Evan looked back and chuckled. “That’s not a hobby!”

## The trouble with hobbies 

It was the response I expected. Of course reading philosophy isn’t a hobby! But I didn’t say as much. Huffing and puffing, I remained mute. We crested the hill and continued pedaling onwards, changing subjects and talking of other things—family, travels, ambitions, the things you talk about with a friend you haven’t seen in ages.

Writing these words now, I realize Evan was right about philosophy not being a hobby, but probably for the wrong reasons. I couldn’t exactly put my finger on why, however, until recently. 

For the past few months, as part of seeking new ways to be a better leader at work, I’ve been working with a coach. The other day I relayed this story to her. In response, she sent me this excerpt from the German philosopher Theodor Adorno’s essay *[Free Time](http://www.xenopraxis.net/readings/adorno_freetime.pdf):*

> I have no hobby. Not that I am the kind of workaholic, who is incapable of doing anything with his time but applying himself industriously to the required task. But, as far as my activities beyond the bounds of my recognised profession are concerned, I take them all, without exception, very seriously.

Now, most of us use the word “hobby” to describe the activities we undertake to occupy our free time, usually to avoid boredom. But in his essay, Adorno rails against both hobbies and the very concept of “free time.” Free time, argues Adorno, only exists because we allow it to exist in contrast to “work time”—“shackled” to its opposite, as he says, so that we may recharge our batteries for future labor-intensive endeavors. According to him, our desire for free time forces us to unwittingly split our lives in two. Thus, for Adorno, hobbies are nothing more than filler activities used for the killing of our supposed “free time” as part of our “rigorous bifurcation” of life.

Back when I lived with Evan, despite the academic workload, I recall having plenty of free time and, therefore, a few hobbies. StarCraft, for one. But if I’m to lean on Adorno’s definition, then reading philosophy, and writing about it on this blog as I have been doing for the past few months, seems to not qualify as a “hobby.” In fact, calling it a hobby seems to do it some kind of disservice, to lessen the value and effort and seriousness of it. Mostly it has been hard, slow-going, cognitively challenging, but ultimately rewarding—exactly what I signed myself up for.

## Revisiting my autodidactic experiment

Earlier this year I kicked off a series of “life habit experiments,” small trials of new ways of living to explore alternative ways towards living a deeper or more fulfilling life. In late August, I embarked on [the second](blog/habit-experiment-2-self-directed-study/) of my [life habit experiments](/blog/habit-experiment-2-self-directed-study/), something I called “self-directed study.”

For this second experiment, I created a reading list and pledged ([on this blog](/blog/habit-experiment-2-self-directed-study/)) that I would spend at least the next 60 days following the list and writing about what I learned. That experiment has become a multi-month autodidactic adventure teaching myself philosophy and reflecting on how my learnings apply to software design practice. I have since read multiple books—mostly on phenomenology—digging into the works of philosophers like Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, even Byung-Chul Han.

I largely undertook this experiment to satisfy my own curiosity and interests. Also in August, I published an essay, [The imp of optimization](/blog/the-imp-of-optimization/), which was a philosophical rumination on our relationship with surveillance technology and the hidden agendas it often foists upon us. It was arguably the most popular essay I’ve written. After the newsletter [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com) featured it, I suddenly started receiving numerous positive emails from readers about how much they enjoyed reading it. I also enjoyed writing it. In fact, writing that essay reminded me how much I enjoy thinking about the intersections of philosophy, cognitive science, and design. So, I thought, why not experiment with doing more of it?

Unfortunately, I have a woefully shallow background in philosophy. As someone who studied computer science in college, I like to joke—borrowing a line from the late computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum—that my computer science background makes me “poorly educated.” My entire undergraduate education consisted of math, physics, computer science, and little else. It wasn’t until I attended graduate school that I was properly exposed to the humanities. But, it’s been fifteen years since I left graduate school, and I’ve found myself pining to return to that atmosphere of deep learning, even if I have to create it on my own. Which is exactly what I’ve been doing.

## Lessons in learning philosophy

One of the first things I learned from this experiment was that I was going to have to learn how to be a student again. And part of being a student entails a certain seriousness about reading—deeply engaging the material, taking notes, revisiting key passages, often reading multiple works about the same idea.

In previous essays I’ve [extolled the virtues of “reading at Whim.”](/blog/read-at-whim/) But this experiment was decidedly anti-Whim. In creating a reading list and following it with unwavering dedication, I forced myself to go deep on specific topics, to finish books I might have otherwise abandoned, and to read material that was immensely challenging—sometimes to the point of utter frustration.

Serious students of philosophy read primary sources. But I quickly learned how difficult this can be, and I wasn’t making it easier for myself in my reading selections. Anyone who has ever endeavored to read Heidegger for the first time understands how absolutely infuriating such an experience can be. Between the obtuse grammatical structure, the obscure, self-invented words translated from German—not to mention his affiliation with the Nazi party—jumping into Heidegger requires tenacity.

I leaned on companion books and secondary material to help me decipher and understand all of it. This included books like Sokolowski’s [Introduction to Phenomenology](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9780521667920), or Taylor Carman’s excellent [Merleau-Ponty](https://bookshop.org/a/106240/9781138689619). But this clustered reading—reading multiple books on the same topics by different authors—has proven immensely valuable. Many of these philosophers write as if in “conversation” with each other. Husserl, for instance, was Heidegger’s teacher. Much of Heidegger’s work thus draws from and extends or criticizes Husserl. Similarly, Merleau-Ponty—who arrived on the scene after Heidegger—builds on Heidegger’s phenomenology, inserting his own perspectives and unique “flavor” of phenomenology focused on the aspects of embodiment. And Byung-Chul Han—a Korean living in Germany, and the most contemporary of the bunch—is arguably in conversation with all of them.

In reading all of these authors together, I learned more deeply than if I had approached each philosopher independently. I saw how certain ideas about the human lived experience shifted and transformed over time. And if, on first reading, a given concept felt opaque or confusing, encountering it again and again through another perspective would often bring new clarity and understanding.

I also (I will openly admit!) used AI to aid in my learning process. Used poorly, LLMs quickly become a crutch, a way to fool yourself and feign learning without actually learning anything. But, with a careful approach, a well-wielded LLM can act as a powerful learning partner, a tool for testing understanding and suggesting new avenues for discovery. I have a lot I can say on this topic, but I’ll have to save it for another day.

As part of my experiment, I shared my thoughts and learnings in an ongoing series of essays. As of now, I’ve published four of these essays: [Phenomenology and the impossibility of experience design](/blog/phenomenology-and-the-impossibility-of-experience-design/), [Parts and wholes and moments, oh my!](/blog/parts-wholes-moments-oh-my/), [Cézanne’s doubts](https://seanvoisen.com/blog/cezannes-doubts/), and [Design for lingering](/blog/design-for-lingering/). I am also currently editing a first draft of a fifth essay. 

I have many more ideas for essays—too many, in fact—and much more I want to learn and read. I take this all rather seriously. I can already say, after a mere two months of experimentation, that I no longer consider the idea of learning and writing about what I learn on these topics to be merely experimental. It’s now something I both want and need to do. It is the thing I do outside of work that I take as seriously as work, except with one small difference: I’m not paid for it. My only constraint is simply: time.

## Research as leisure

The thing to understand about Adorno is that he was an academic. And most academics enjoy something many of us don’t: their paid work and personal passions often overlap. Thus, they manage to avoid that pesky psychological divide between “free time” and “work time.” Adorno admits this privilege directly:

> ... I have been fortunate enough that my job, the production of philosophical and sociological works and university teaching, cannot be defined in terms of that strict opposition to free time ... I speak as one who has had the rare opportunity to follow the path of his own intentions and to fashion his work accordingly.

I’ve observed this privilege firsthand in other professional academics. In grad school, in which I studied art and computer science, my thesis advisor was both a sculptor and avid sailor. His latest art project: designing and prototyping of sustainable, decarbonized boats for island and coastal communities. He’s literally building models—sculptures—of boats. If that’s not a near 100% overlap in the Venn diagram between personal intentions and paid work, I don’t know what is.

I don’t say this out of envy. I enjoy my work and my writing on topics of design and philosophy fortunately *does* overlap with my work, albeit the overlap is smaller in practice. But I'm not sure the amount of overlap really matters.

Ironically, in his essay Adorno mentions a contrasting term to "free time"—leisure—but then goes on to say very little about it. Whereas “free time” exists only in contrast with time reserved for labor and work, leisure sits beyond this uncomfortable dichotomy. We typically think of the leisurely life as one unconstrained by the demands of work, unconcerned with the difference between “free time” and “work time.” Adorno calls this life “auspicious;” Marx might say “bourgeois.”

But what if leisure isn't just for the privileged few? Aristotle, for instance, saw leisure as essential to a fulfilled life. In the *Nicomachean Ethics*, he argued that leisure plays a central role in living well and achieving *eudaimonia*—a Greek word often translated as happiness, but better understood as “human flourishing.” The Aristotelian view of leisure thus distinguishes it from “free time” in both approach and attitude. For Aristotle, leisure was not time set aside for mere relaxation, nor should it serve as “a remedy for the ills of work.” Rather, he intended that it serve the higher purpose of cultivating one’s virtue and character. Philosophic contemplation he considered to be the highest purpose of all.

There’s a wonderful [essay by Celine Nguyen](https://www.personalcanon.com/p/research-as-leisure-activity), in which she discusses the idea of “research as a leisure activity.” I loved this particular framing of one’s peculiar autodidactic pursuits as *leisure*. It feels very Aristotelian. Nguyen writes:

> The idea of research as leisure activity has stayed with me because it seems to describe a kind of intellectual inquiry that comes from idiosyncratic passion and interest. It’s not about the formal credentials. It’s fundamentally about play. It seems to describe a life where it’s just fun to be reading, learning, writing, and collaborating on ideas.

I agree: anyone with the fortitude and wherewithal to pursue research and writing should feel free to do so, formal credentials be damned. But if we are to draw on the ancient Greek understanding of leisure, then we should be careful not to allow words like “fun” and “play” introduce too much frivolity either. Leisure can be serious, as Adorno seems to be reminding us.

Taking it seriously, however, doesn’t mean our leisure pursuits should feel laborious. We need not turn our leisure into a second kind of work. We don’t have to make it a “hustle culture” side-project of soul-sucking toil. Rather, leisure should feed our souls. We should relentlessly seek out those activities that challenge us, lift up our spirits, and help us grow. Fun, sometimes, but also plenty serious. 

What Adorno seems to be saying is that the difference lies in whether we feel genuinely free in our pursuits, or whether we simply bring to them the same compulsions that govern our working lives. Taking leisure seriously means refusal to reduce everything to either work or its shadow. The difference between free time and leisure time is thus not so much about *fun* as it is about *freedom*.

Looking back on it now, I believe this is what Evan had in mind when he jokingly said that philosophy is not a hobby. What he meant was that reading philosophy and writing about it doesn’t sound *fun*. And I will admit: it has not been fun, at least not all of the time. It has been challenging. This is, however, the ironic joy of it. But to call it *work* feels wrong too. Instead, I think it exists somewhere in that same rare space that Adorno also carved out for himself: the space for serious pursuits “beyond the bounds” of “his recognised profession,” whatever that may be.
