Several years ago, not long after my wife and I first started dating, we took a trip to visit her family Philadelphia. It was a cold and rainy December, but I had never been to Philadelphia before so, despite the miserable weather, we tried to make the most of it. We hit all the obligatory tourist stops the city had to offer—Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, the Italian Market, the cheesesteak stands, of course, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the steps leading up to which were made famous by the movie *Rocky*. But, the one destination we failed to make time for during that trip was [The Barnes Foundation](https://www.barnesfoundation.org), a unique (and [controversial](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/09/arts/design/barnes-foundation-loan-painting-decision.html)) institution that houses and exhibits a massive private collection of art assembled by the chemist and businessman Albert C. Barnes in the early 20th century. Fortunately, we returned to Philadelphia a few months later, this time during a mild and sunny week in June, and soon made our way to the sleek stone and glass building that houses the collection.

By that time in my life, I had visited my fair share of art museums, but The Barnes Foundation left a lasting impression. To this day, over ten years later, I remember it vividly. Unlike a traditional art museum, The Barnes Foundation exhibits  art in curious "ensembles"—juxtapositions of paintings mixed and matched with everyday objects like door hinges, glassware and furniture. The foundation’s collection includes works by Van Gogh, Matisse, Rousseau, Picasso, and many others. But some of my favorite paintings in the collection are those by Paul Cézanne.

Cézanne was a famously volatile artist. He was plagued by depression, and known for a temperament that swung between periods of immense passion, and periods of intense self-doubt. This doubt, however, may have proved immensely productive—indeed it might have been the driving force behind Cézanne’s artistic greatness.

## Art and embodiment

In 1945, the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty (which I will hereafter abbreviate as M-P) published [Cézanne's Doubt (PDF)](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/christianmieves/files/2020/03/Merleau-Ponty-Maurice-Sense-and-Nonsense_Cezanne.pdf), a short essay exploring the ties between Cézanne's unique artistic method, his intense self-doubt, and M-P's own take on phenomenology.

Much of M-P’s philosophical project involved trying to revise phenomenological thinking in order to emphasize the criticality of *embodiment.* That is, M-P argued that the human body is central to how we experience the world, not something to consider as an afterthought. He claimed our bodies are neither subject nor object, but rather a kind of ambiguous third party that serves as the source of all perception. And in *Cézanne’s Doubt*, as we shall soon see, M-P argued that Cézanne’s embodiment was in fact central to how we perceived and chose to depict the world through art. 

In the opening to the essay, M-P writes of Cézanne:

> It took him one hundred working sessions for a still life, one hundred fifty sittings for a portrait. What we call his work was, for him, an attempt, an approach to painting ... Painting was his world and his mode of existence. He worked alone without students, without admiration from his family, without encouragement from the critics. He painted on the afternoon of the day his mother died. In 1870 he was painting at l'Estaque while the police were after him for dodging the draft. And, still, he had moments of doubt about this vocation. As he grew old, he wondered whether the novelty of his painting might not come from trouble with his eyes, whether his whole life had not been based upon an accident of his body.

A post-impressionist, Cézanne sought to paint not merely what he saw, but rather to depict his more primordial perception of the world. You could say that he was, in his own way, a kind of artist-phenomenologist; he painted what he perceived rather than merely what he conceived. He sought sensation over judgement, to be a painter who sees beyond what he thinks. Indeed, in an article in *Le Salon*, he even once declared: "I paint as I see, as I perceive." 

But Cézanne's conception of perception went beyond mere visual sensation. His was rooted in his embodied, lived experience. For him, it seems that art-making served as a means for exploring what his unique experience of perception felt like *in his body*, much in the same way writers use the process of writing to understand what they think.

## Cézanne’s first doubt

Cézanne's unconventional approach to painting meant his work often failed to conform to traditional approaches to color, technique and perspective. During much of his lifetime, contemporary critics regularly attacked his work. One critic called his art "the painting of a drunken privy cleaner." It's little wonder, then, that he doubted whether his art would ever amount to much. 

But Cézanne's self-doubt did not just grow out of a few bitter seeds planted by critics. It was also intrinsic to his aspirations and way of being. He set an astonishingly high bar for himself. Indeed, in his pursuit to paint exactly as he perceived, he also chased the "perfect work of art" that he saw in nature itself. As M-P writes:

> Cézanne ... conceived painting not as the incarnation of imagined scenes, the projection of dreams outward, but as the exact study of appearances: less a work of the studio than a working from nature.

> Of nature, he said that "the artist must conform to this perfect work of art. Everything comes to us from nature; we exist through it; nothing else is worth remembering."

This is the first doubt of *Cézanne's Doubt*: the existential doubt of an artist troubled by an overwhelming desire to express something through painting, while simultaneously doubting whether such expression was ever possible.

## Cézanne’s second doubt

If we were to stop here, we would learn something about Cézanne and his motivations, but I also feel we would miss the entire point of M-P’s essay. We would miss the deeper, second doubt of *Cézanne’s Doubt*: the methodological doubt of the artist-phenomenologist.

Core to the practice of phenomenology is something called the "epoché," which is just a fancy term for "bracketing off" our normal preconceived notions about how we both think the world works, and how we should experience it. The epoché does not imply a need to doubt *everything* we know, but rather asks us to *allow for the possibility* of doubting our everyday beliefs in order to get to the root of subjective experience. It is, in short, a willingness to *entertain* doubt. And M-P argues that Cézanne used something akin to this method in his own artistic practice to move beyond mere seeing and express his own embodied perception of a scene. We find evidence of this in his paintings.

At The Barnes Foundation, I remember standing transfixed before Cézanne's "Mont Sainte-Victoire," for a long time. It's one of my most vivid memories of my time there. What it was about this particular painting that kept me lingering in place for several minutes, I still can't say. On the surface, Mont Sainte-Victoire appears to be just a painting of a mountain on a clear day, foregrounded by fields and farmhouses, with what appears to be an ancient viaduct somewhere in the middle distance. But, a closer inspection reveals the fascinating ways in which Cézanne chose to depict this scene. The mountain, for instance, supposedly in the distant background, instead looms vividly in bright color, almost startlingly close and present. The geometry of the various buildings that dot the landscape looks slightly "off," not respecting any traditional or "correct" methods of perspective. And Cézanne's signature parallel, vertical brushstrokes seem to draw both the trees and mountains upwards, as if actually growing out of the ground.

## Cézanne’s phenomenology

Cézanne seemed to perceive the landscape much differently than other painters I'd ever encountered. As M-P explains:

> His painting was paradoxical: he was pursuing reality without giving up the sensuous surface, with no other guide than the immediate impression of nature, without following the contours, with no outline to enclose the color, with no perspectival or pictorial arrangement.

Courtesy of The Barnes Foundation.")

Cézanne was known for projecting space and representing perspective in non-traditional ways. The art historian [Paul Smith argues](https://faculty.winthrop.edu/stockk/Cezanne%20primitive.pdf) this was due to the way Cézanne paid close attention to his embodied experience of vision. Citing the work of psychologists A. David Milner and Melvyn Goodale, who claim we have both systems of "vision for perception" and "vision for action," Smith argues Cézanne may have been trying to capture these two ways of seeing in a single image. He quotes a conversation Cézanne had with the artist Jules Borély in 1902:

> Look, that tree trunk: between us and it there is a space, an atmosphere, I grant you that. But then again it is this palpable, resistant trunk, this body ... See like someone who has just been born! 

Two things stand out in this snippet of conversation. First, as Smith points out, there’s the *this* in "this body." If we are to agree that we have two ways of seeing—both for perception and for action—then Cézanne seems to be indicating that the tree trunk is simultaneously distant and close at hand. For such a thing to seem possible we have to reconcile with how we experience these two ways of seeing. Smith notes that in vision for perception we notice the distances separating objects. Whereas because vision for action represents our own "tactile space," we pay closer attention to the space between us as perceiver and the perceived object. This, I think, is what I noticed in my long inspection of Mont Sainte-Victoire—a distant mountain made simultaneously "palpable" and "resistant" through color and size.

Second is Cézanne’s exhortation to "see like someone who has just been born!" It's as if Cézanne is telling Borély to abandon habitual ways of seeing to return to some more primordial state—to adopt a true "beginner's mind" approach to vision itself. But notice how physical and embodied this metaphor is. A newborn's vision isn't just conceptually innocent—it's physiologically different. Newborns are still learning to focus, to separate figure from ground, and to judge distance. The world hasn't yet separated into discrete objects but exists as a unified field of sensation. I think this is what M-P found most compelling about Cézanne: his desire to return to a more fundamental, embodied way of seeing.

## What we can learn

Cézanne was a painter, not a designer, so it might be natural to ask at this point: What does any of this have to do with design? What can we learn? Here are some possible takeaways.

### Look at process over product

First, there is value in doubt if we learn how to leverage it productively. Cézanne's almost maniacal commitment to capturing the "perfect work of art" he saw in nature, however unobtainable, allowed him to embrace process over predetermined outcomes. Cézanne was notorious for abandoning his work. As [art historian Harry Cooper writes](https://www.artforum.com/events/cezanne-finished-unfinished-193449/), his "oeuvre is littered with paintings in various states of incompletion." He dedicated himself to his artistic process above any desire to merely finish.

Now, design cannot be all process and no results. Cooper also tells us that Cézanne had inherited his father's estate in 1886, affording him the luxury of no longer needing to regularly sell his artwork in order to maintain a living.

Design has no such luxury; it often serves the needs of business, and must deliver. But there's fertile ground in embracing iterative approaches that remain open to change, rather than committing too early to specific concepts. And even within constraints, we can steal Cézanne's trick: treat each iteration as an investigation, not just a step toward completion. The best insights often emerge from work we consider unfinished.

### Embrace methodological doubt

Next, perhaps there is something to Cézanne's epoché, his deliberate suspension of what he knew about mountains, buildings, color, and perspective. It suggests a radical—albeit controversial—tool: methodological doubt. We're often told to rely on best practices, design systems, and user research data. These are valuable, even essential. But what happens when we bracket them off to see what else might emerge? Perhaps we might arrive at more interesting solutions. 

For designers, this kind of methodological doubt can serve as a practice of looking deeper, seeking to identify what we’re not seeing because we think we already “know.” How might this work? There are numerous exercises we can use to allow for the possibility of doubt and see things with fresh eyes. For visual design this might mean trying to describe a design using only words for texture, temperature or sound. Or maybe it means revisiting a design first thing in the morning, before paging in the entire context of a project. For other design work, we can consider perspective shifts such as intentionally designing the worst possible solution, or listing all your constraints and designing as if the opposites were true.

The phenomenological epoché isn’t about deliberate ignorance. It’s not about intentionally disregarding best practices for no particular reason either. Cézanne knew the rules of perspective perfectly well; he chose to break them in order to seek out something deeper, something more true to his experience by not accepting the rules as “fact.”

### Use perception as material

Lastly, Cézanne used perception as raw material. He didn’t paint mountains; he painted his perception of mountains. Designers can adopt a similar approach. When we design a loading animation, we’re not merely filling time; we’re designing the perception of duration. When we choose between a sharp corner and a rounded one, we’re working with how edges feel to the eye, how they guide or arrest movement across a screen. When we design for accessibility through well-contrasted color choices, we respect the needs of people who may perceive the world differently than ourselves.

To do this well, we must recognize that perceptual material behaves differently than purely visual material. First, it’s culturally influenced and contextually defined. The color red, for instance means “error” or “stop” in one context, and “luck” in another. Perceptual material is also physiologically grounded. We can't help but notice motion in our peripheral vision. And we’re forced into specific sequences of attention simply by how blurring background objects. When Cézanne painted what he perceived rather than what he merely saw, he was playing with these properties of perception too, showing how distance and nearness could coexist, or how solidity and atmosphere interpenetrate.

## Mountains as meditations

Cézanne painted Mont Sainte-Victoire more than thirty times in his lifetime. He called this particular mountain his “motif,” returning to it again and again in order that he might not just learn to see the landscape, but that he might learn to really *experience* it. He seemed to never tire of this view. 

In the middle of his essay, M-P describes at length how Cézanne approached painting this particular scene:

> He would start by discovering the geological foundations of the landscape; then, according to Mme Cezanne, he would halt and look at everything with widened eyes, "germinating" with the countryside ... Then he began to paint all parts of the painting at the same time, using patches of color to surround his original charcoal sketch of the geological skeleton. The picture took on fullness and density; it grew in structure and balance; it came to maturity all at once. "The landscape thinks itself in me," he would say, "and I am its consciousness."

To paint Mont Sainte-Victoire over and over again was, for Cézanne, part of an ongoing conversation between mountain and paint, perception and expression. It was, in short, a meditation—not a search for the right answer, but a practice of remaining available to what wants to appear. Sometimes design can work like this too: in remaining attuned to our own perception, problems can think themselves anew through us, and then, just maybe, the right solution will naturally emerge.
